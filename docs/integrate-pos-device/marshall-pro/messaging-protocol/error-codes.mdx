title: "Error Codes"
---

This page provides a reference of error codes. Errors are universal across all API methods. They are returned by the terminal's JSON parser before the requested command is even executed.

| Code | Meaning | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1001** | **Invalid JSON** | The system could not parse the message payload because it has an invalid JSON structure. |
| **1002** | **Unknown Command** | The terminal doesn't recognize the `command` name. |
| **1003** | **Required Parameter Missing** | The request is missing a mandatory field (such as `requestId`). |

### Error Handling Best Practices

To ensure a high-quality integration, follow these guidelines:

* **Logging**: Always log both the `errorCode` and the descriptive `errorMessage` to facilitate debugging.
* **Retries**: Implement client-side retry logic if the terminal does not respond within the expected window.
* **Safety**: Never automatically retry a declined transaction without a direct user action.
* **Typical Timeouts**: Use the following time windows for client-side monitoring:
  * **Card Detection:** 30–60 seconds.
  * **User Input:** 60–120 seconds.
  * **Authorization:** 10–30 seconds.

<Note>
**User Feedback**
Always provide clear visual feedback on the POS screen during wait times or when an error occurs to keep the customer informed.
