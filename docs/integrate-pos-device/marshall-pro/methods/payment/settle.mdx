title: "settle"
description: "Finalize a pre-authorized transaction with the actual fueling amount."
---

The `settle` method is the final step in the fuel transaction lifecycle. It "captures" or finalizes a previously authorized transaction once the dispensing process is complete, ensuring the customer is only charged for the exact amount of fuel delivered.

Use this method to:
* Convert a temporary pre-authorization hold into a final financial charge.
* Finalize the transaction with an amount that is typically less than or equal to the original authorized hold.
* Complete the transaction sequence to generate final logs and release the session.

## Requests

To call this method, you must provide the `transactionId` received during the `authorize` or `detectAndAuth` phase, along with the final `amount`.

The following example shows a typical request:
```json
{
"command": "settle",
"requestId": "req-003",
"data": {
"transactionId": "TXN-20260113-003000",
"amount": 42000,
"volume": 30000,
"product": "Diesel"
}
}

```
