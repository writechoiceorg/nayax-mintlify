title: "cardDetect"
description: "Enable the reader to detect and read payment methods without immediate authorization."
---

The `cardDetect` method activates the terminal's reader to identify and capture data from a payment method (Card or QR) without initiating a financial hold or charge. It serves as a versatile tool for workflows where customer identification must precede the payment phase.

Use this method to:
* Recognize customers via loyalty cards or mobile QR codes to apply personalized discounts.
* Retrieve masked card data to welcome returning users or verify membership status.
* Use card data to determine eligible fuel types or promotions before requesting authorization.
* Accept Contactless (CTLS), Chip (EMV), Magnetic Stripe (Swipe), and QR code scanning.

## Requests

All requests must include the `command` and a unique `requestId`. While this method does not authorize funds, an `amount` must be provided for display purposes on the terminal screen.

The following example shows a typical request:
```json
{
"command": "cardDetect",
"requestId": "req-005",
"data": {
"amount": 50000,
"tranType": 1,
"channels": ["CTLS", "CHIP", "SWIPE"]
}
}
```

This is how this request appears on a Nayax device: 


### Parameter Definitions

The table below describes the parameters available for the detection request:

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **amount** | integer | Yes | The amount to display on the screen during detection (refer to `decimalPlace`). |
| **tranType** | integer | No | `1`: Pre-authorization, `2`: Pre-selection (Default is `1`). |
| **channels** | array | No | Defines allowed payment methods: `CTLS`, `CHIP`, `SWIPE`, or `QR`. Defaults to all if omitted. |

## Responses

The VPOS terminal returns a response once the user interacts with the reader or a QR code is successfully scanned.

The following example shows a typical **credit card** response:
```json
{
"requestId": "req-005",
"data": {
"state": "CARD_READ",
"cardBrand": "VISA",
"cardEntryMode": "CTLS",
"maskedPan": "************1234",
"aid": "A0000000031010"
}
}
```

The following example shows a typical **QR code** response:
```json
{
"requestId": "req-005",
"data": {
"state": "CARD_READ",
"cardEntryMode": "QR",
"qrCode": "1168743871706458"
}
}
```

  **Note:** When using `cardDetect` for non-credit card methods (such as proprietary QR codes), the client system is responsible for any subsequent authorization or settlement logic.
