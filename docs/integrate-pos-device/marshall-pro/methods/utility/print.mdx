title: "print"
description: "Trigger the integrated thermal printer to generate custom receipts or documents."
---

The `print` method provides direct access to the VPOS terminal's integrated thermal printer. This allows the client application to generate physical records for the customer, such as transaction receipts, loyalty vouchers, or fueling summaries.

Use this method to:
* Print finalized sale details, including merchant info, masked card data, and totals for transaction receipts.
* Generate a physical record of the volume, grade, and price per unit after the nozzle is holstered.
* Provide customers with discount codes or reward vouchers based on their current purchase.
* Print diagnostic or status reports directly at the station for maintenance logs.
