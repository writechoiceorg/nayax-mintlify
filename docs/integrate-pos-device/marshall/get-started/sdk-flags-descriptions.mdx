title: "SDK Flags"
---

The `vmc_configuration` object allows you to set various configuration flags. When using the Marshall SDK, these determine the behavior and capabilities of the peripheral (originally intended for vending machine controller -VMC).

## Configuration Flags

You can initiate these flags in the `main` method, as in the following code:

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
public static void main(string[] args) {
        vmc_config.multi_vend_support = false;
        vmc_config.multi_session_support = false;
        vmc_config.price_not_final_support = false;
        vmc_config.reader_always_on = false;
        vmc_config.always_idle = false;
        vmc_config.vend_denied_policy = vmc_configuration.vend_denied_policy_cancel;
        vmc_config.explicit_vend_success = false;
        vmc_config.long_price = false;

        vmc_config.mifare_approved_by_vmc_support = false;
        vmc_config.mag_card_approved_by_vmc_support = false;
        vmc_config.qr_approved_by_vmc_support = false;

        vmc_config.dump_packets_level = vmc_configuration.debug_level_dump_moderate;
        vmc_config.debug = true;
}
```

```csharp C#
public class vend_machine
            vmc_config.multi_session_support = false;
            vmc_config.multi_vend_support = false;
            vmc_config.price_not_final_support = false;
            vmc_config.reader_always_on = false;
            vmc_config.always_idle = false;
            vmc_config.explicit_vend_success = false;
            vmc_config.vend_denied_policy = vmc_configuration.vend_denied_policy_cancel;
            vmc_config.long_price = true;

            vmc_config.mag_card_approved_by_vmc_support = false;
            vmc_config.mifare_approved_by_vmc_support = false;
```

```c C
static void vmc_init(void)
{
	config.multi_vend_support = __false;
	config.multi_session_support = __false;
	config.price_not_final_support = __false;
	config.reader_always_on = __false;
	config.always_idle = __false;
	config.explicit_vend_success = __false;
	config.vend_denied_policy = vend_denied_policy_persist_e;

	config.mifare_approved_by_vmc_support = __false;
	config.mag_card_approved_by_vmc_support = __false;
	config.qr_approved_by_vmc_support  = __false;

	config.dump_packets_level = debug_level_dump_moderate;
  config.debug = __true;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Flag Descriptions

    <tr>
      <td>
        `multi_vend_support`
      </td>

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        Enabling the sale and differentiation of multiple products in a single transaction.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `multi_session_support`
      </td>

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        Enables the device to handle multiple sessions simultaneously, which is useful for scenarios where various transactions may be open at the same time.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `price_not_final_support`
      </td>

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        Relevant for multi-session (pre-selection) flow only. Indicates that the authorization price received from the server is not final, meaning using it alongside Multi-session would have it behave similarly to a pre-authorization process, ensuring the balance isn't captured for a few days.
        You can read more on that in the [Multi-Session](/docs/integrate-pos-device/marshall/payment-flows/marshall-multi-session#/)  for more details.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `reader_always_on`
      </td>

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        It keeps the device's reader always turned on and ready to start transactions from the device's end instead of the peripheral. When used, a trigger for the product selection would be a card presentation or touching a button on the device instead of selecting a product on the peripheral's end.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `always_idle`
      </td>

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        The transaction starts with the consumer selecting a product on the peripheral. The peripheral can send the "Vend request" command without waiting for a "Begin Session" trigger.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `vend_denied_policy`
      </td>

      <td>

        irrelevant, N/A.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `explicit_vend_success`
      </td>

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        If you have a long vend operation you can set this flag to true, and then after you get the onVendApproved(), you can perform the slow vend operation and then on your time, call vend\_status(true/false) for vend success/failure, in order to conclude the transaction.

        (the onVendApproved would return a dummy "true", meaning it would release the thread but the SDK would still wait for your actual response regarding the vending result, which is what you'd do in the "vend\_status" command)

        Allows Mifare (prepaid) cards to be authorized by a third-party server. The card's data is being forwarded to the peripheral and it is up for it to approve/decline the card.
