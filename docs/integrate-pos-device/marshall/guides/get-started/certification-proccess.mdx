title: "Certification Process"
---

The Marshall certification process consists of a list of tests you, the customer, must complete after you complete the SDK's implementation. These tests are done to ensure stability before rolling out and to avoid unexpected, unwanted issues on your end.

## The Certification Process

Once you've reached this point, you'd be asked asked to notify your Nayax integrator about it and we'd send you a certification test file to match the flow you're using (Single Session/ Multisession/ Multivend).
The file includes explanations about the tests you need to do, as well as the steps that need to be done in order to complete each one of them. As would have been explained to you during the integration, I would need you to enable the SDK's logging (and keep those on even after rollout, as this is Nayax's main debugging tool which would allow us to assist with figuring out any possible issues you encounter have after rollout) and have you send your Nayax integrator each test result in a different file.
The testing process is not long (assuming that the implementation was done correctly), yet it covers most, if not all, edge cases. During testing, you will receive guidance and assistance from your Nayax integrator until completion.

What happens once the certification is completed? And why is it important to allow rollout only after completing the certification?

Once all of the mandatory tests are completed successfully, meaning your Nayax integrator has received the logs for them and approved of all of them- he would let the you know that the integration and certification process have been completed successfully by sending you an official certification letter and notify the distributor about it, and only at this point would the distributor allow you to roll out.

**Important Note**

The certification is valid for 3 years. To maintain compliance, you may be required to re-certify after this period to ensure your SDK implementation and Marshall-related services continue to operate as expected.
