Integrating the EMV Core SDK into an Android environment allows for pre-certified EMV payment processing within a Kiosk or POS application. This guide covers the system requirements and the step-by-step installation process for the version.

### System Requirements and SDK Files

Before beginning, ensure the host hardware meets the following criteria:

* **Android OS**: Version 7 or above.
* **Network**: Stable internet communication with TLS v1.2 or above.
* **Permissions**: The application must have permission to read `/sys/class`.
* **SDK Package Components**:
  1. `com.nayax.emvCore-release-v.v-bbb.apk`: The mandatory EMV-Core service package.
  2. `com.nayax.emv_core_android_test-release-v.v-bbb.apk`: The sample application used for testing.
  3. `emv-core-test-v.v-bbb.zip`: An Android Studio project containing a library and sample source code in Java.

### Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install the SDK on Android:

1. **Deploy APKs**: Install the EMV-Core Service package followed by the Test application on the target Android device.
2. **Hardware Connection**: Connect the UNO reader to the Android device.
3. **System Prompts**:
   * When the system prompts you to "Allow EmvCore Service to access Saturn 8700," check the "Always open..." box and press **OK** to whitelist the reader.
   * Select **Allow** on the "Stop optimizing battery usage" prompt to keep the service running in the background.
4. **Restarting**: If communication issues occur between the reader and the application, restart the service.

### Verification

Once the applications are running and the reader is connected, the status line at the top of the test application screen should display **"Ready"**. You can then navigate to the **'Maintenance'** page and press **'Get Data'** to retrieve software versions and hardware status.
