title: "displaySelect"
description: "Present the customer with a list of options for selection on the terminal screen."

The `displaySelect` method allows the client application to present a menu or a list of choices to the customer. This serves as a key component for interactive workflows where the user must make a decision before the transaction can proceed.

Use this method to:
* Offer product selections between different fuel grades, such as Regular, Mid-grade, or Premium.
* Enable language selection to allow the customer to choose their preferred language for the session.
* Present service options like adding a car wash or selecting a specific pump number.
* Provide loyalty choices, such as asking the user to "Use Points" or "Save for Later."

Example of the menu display prompt on a Nayax device:

## Requests

All requests must include a `title` for the menu and an array of `options`. Each option should have a label that the customer will see.

The following example shows a typical request:
```json
{
"command": "displaySelect",
"requestId": "req-009",
"data": {
"title": "Please Select Fuel Type",
