title: "stopCardDetect"
description: "Deactivate the terminal reader and cancel the card detection phase."
---

The `stopCardDetect` method is a utility command used to manually deactivate the terminal's reader. This serves to maintain control over the user experience when a transaction is abandoned or a different workflow is required.

Use this method to:
* Terminate the detection phase if a customer cancels the operation at the pump or POS.
* Close the reader safely if a locally managed timeout is reached without user interaction.
* Clear the reader state to prepare the terminal for a different command or a return to the idle screen.

Example of the stop detection screen on a Nayax device:

## Requests

This request is a simple trigger and does not require a `data` object. You must provide the standard `command` and a unique `requestId`.

The following example shows a typical request:
```json
{
"command": "stopCardDetect",
"requestId": "req-004"
}
```
