title: "Request and Response Format"
---

The Marshall Pro protocol uses a unified JSON structure for every message. This consistency allows you to build a single "wrapper" in your code to handle all terminal communications.

## Request Object

Every command sent from your system to the VPOS must follow this structure:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| command | `string` | Yes | The name of the API method (e.g., `"status"`, `"pay"`). |
| requestId | `string` | Yes | A unique ID used to track the response. |
| data | `object` | No | A container for the specific parameters of the command. |

### Request Example

```json
{
  "command": "<command_name>",
  "requestId": "<unique_request_id>",
  "data": {
    "param1": "value1",
    "param2": "value2"
  }
}
```

## Response Object
The terminal's response always mirrors your `requestId` so your system knows exactly which command is being answered.

Success Response
If the command is processed successfully, the terminal returns the requested information inside the `data` object.

```json
{
  "requestId": "<request_id_echo>",
  "data": {
    "status": "success",
    "details": "..."
  }
}
```

## Error Response
If an issue occurs, the response will include an error code and a descriptive message.

```json
{
  "requestId": "<request_id_echo>",
  "errorCode": 400,
  "errorMessage": "Invalid command parameters"
}
```
