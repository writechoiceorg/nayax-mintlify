title: "authorizePendingTransactions"
---

The `authorizePendingTransactions` method processes and finalizes all transactions that are currently in a pending state.

This method is essential for merchants who use deferred payment transactions. It allows them to finalize multiple pending transactions in a single batch operation and retrieve a summary of which transactions were approved or declined.

## Request

<Note>
**JSON-RPC 2.0**

All methods in TweezerComm follow a JSON-RPC 2.0 structure. See [Get Started](/docs/integration-tweezer)for more details on how the requests are structured and sent.
</Note>

In the request, ensure to configure the following:

* The `method` field needs to be set to.`authorizePendingTransactions`.
* The service must be set to `ashrait` in the `params`.

```json
{
   "jsonrpc":"2.0",
   "method":"authorizePendingTransactions",
   "params":[
      "ashrait",
      {}
   ],
   "id":1
}
```

This method does not require any parameters in the params object.
