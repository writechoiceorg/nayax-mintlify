The `uploadLogs` method sends diagnostic logs from the terminal to the Modularity back-end systems. This is useful for troubleshooting, support, and system monitoring.

## Request

All methods in TweezerComm follow a JSON-RPC 2.0 structure. See [Get Started](/docs/integrate-pos-device/tweezercomm/tweezercomm-get-started) for more details on how the requests are structured and sent.
</Note>

In the request, the method field should be set to `uploadLogs`, and the params must include the service name device:
