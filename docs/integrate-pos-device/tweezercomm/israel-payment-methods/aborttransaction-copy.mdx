title: "abortTransaction"
---

The `abortTransaction `method cancels an ongoing transaction before it is registered in the database, meaning before a doTransaction Response is received (= prior to a consumer's card presentation / prior to a transaction timeout taking place).\
This ensures that transactions in progress but not yet finalized can be safely terminated without affecting the merchant's records.

This method is beneficial when a user initiates a transaction but cancels before completion or when an issue is detected during processing that requires stopping the transaction.

## Request
