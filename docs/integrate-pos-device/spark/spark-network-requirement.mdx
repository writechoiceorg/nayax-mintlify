For communication between Nayax and the Integrator, we support HTTPS with TLS 1.2 and 1.3.

## Whitelist IP's

To ensure smooth communication, the following Nayax public IPs should be whitelisted on the Integrator’s side:

* **Production Servers**:
  * DE (Germany): 137.221.37.126, 185.159.234.2
  * US (United States): 72.28.118.100, 72.28.111.132, 185.159.233.2
  * IL (Israel): 185.159.232.2, 84.110.125.194, 82.102.172.206, 212.179.76.198
* **QA servers**: 31.154.55.2

If required, the Integrator should also allow access from the Nayax QA environment for the Nayax QA team to conduct automation testing.
