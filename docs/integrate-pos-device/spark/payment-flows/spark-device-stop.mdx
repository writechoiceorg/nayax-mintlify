title: "Device Stop"
---

The Spark API facilitates card validation and comparison via the Nayax point-of-sale (POS) terminal. Integrators have two options for handling card validation during a device stop flow:

* `StopNotify`: This method should be used when you want to handle card validation yourself.
* `StopCallback`: This option allows you to leave card validation to Nayax.

In both cases, Nayax does not manage session lifecycles, this responsibility lies entirely with you. You will still need to stop the session yourself.

## `StopNotify`

If you choose to perform the card comparison, Nayax will send a `StopNotify `request. It provides the details of the card used for the stop event. You then need to match these cards to an ongoing session and return the relevant Spark and Nayax transaction IDs for the session to be stopped.

Rejecting a `StopNotify` request will result in a rejection message displayed on the Nayax terminal for the consumer. However, this rejection does not impact the actual session status, as Nayax does not manage the session. You still need to perform the necessary actions to stop the session on their end.

## `StopCallback`

If you prefer Nayax to perform the card comparison, Nayax will send a `StopCallback`. In this scenario, Nayax searches for an unsettled transaction associated with the card used for the stop request. If a match is found, Nayax will notify you with the relevant Spark and Nayax transaction IDs, indicating which session needs to be stopped.

You remain responsible for actually stopping the session
