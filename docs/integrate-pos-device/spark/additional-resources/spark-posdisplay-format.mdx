title: "PosDisplay Format"
---

This page details the required format for data sent to the Nayax POS device for display. Adhering to this format ensures information is presented correctly on the terminal screen, enhancing the user experience.

## Format Specification

Each display element must consist of a `label` and a `value`, separated by a colon (`:`). Elements are then delimited by a semicolon (`;`). Complete values may optionally arrive empty.

The overall structure is as follows:

```
str0{label}:str0{value};str1{label}:str1{value};str2{label}:str2{value};str3{label}:str3{value};...;str5{label}:str5{value};\`
```

Where:

* `str0`: This element is special and holds the value that will be presented in the headline of the POS device screen. If `str0` is not provided, the default headline displayed is "Tariff".

* `str1`: This element is special and holds a value that will be propagated to the next user interface (UI) slide when payment presentation is requested. If `str1` is not provided, subsequent strings (`str2`, `str3`, etc.) will shift one line up in the display.
