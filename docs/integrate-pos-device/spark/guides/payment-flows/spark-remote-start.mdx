title: "Remote Start"
---

In the Remote Start Flow, your remote server initiates the transaction, directing Nayax to activate a specific device. This method is particularly suited for scenarios where the transaction begins from an application or a computer, rather than directly at the Nayax terminal.

The Remote Start flows use the following Spark methods:

* [StartAuthentication](/reference/spark/transactions/startauthentication)
* [TriggerTransaction](/reference/spark/transactions/triggertransaction)
* [TransactionCallback](/reference/spark/transactions/transactioncallback)
* [Settlement](/reference/spark/transactions/settlement)
* [CancelTransaction](/reference/spark/transactions/canceltransaction)
* [TimeoutCallback](/reference/spark/transactions/timeoutcallback)
* [DeclineCallback](/reference/spark/transactions/declinecallback)

<Note>
**Payment Flows**

Remote Start supports both pre-authorization and pre-selection transaction flows. The sections below provide a more detailed breakdown of each flow.

## Pre-Authorization Flow

To understand the device start pre-authorization flow, see the diagram below:

<Frame><img src="/images/docs/spark-remote-start/image1.png" /></Frame>

Below is a breakdown of the diagram:

1. A consumer starts a session on a service station, which sends a [`StartAuthentication`](/docs/startauthentication) request to the Nayax Server via a 3rd Party Server.
2. The Nayax Server responds to the 3rd Party Server with a [`StartAuthenticationResponse`](/docs/startauthenticationresponse).
3. The 3rd Party Server sends a [`TriggerTransaction`](/docs/triggertransaction) request to the Nayax Server.
4. The Nayax Server sends a "Wake Up" command to the Nayax Device.
5. The Nayax Device responds to the Nayax Server, confirming it has woken up.
6. The Nayax Server sends a [`TriggerTransactionResponse`](/docs/triggertransactionresponse) back to the 3rd Party Server.
7. The consumer presents their card to the Nayax Device. The Nayax Device then sends an [`AuthorizationRequest`](/docs/authorizationrequest) to the Nayax Server.
8. The Nayax Server performs authorization with a Payment Provider and sends a [`TransactionCallback`](/docs/transactioncallback) to the 3rd Party Server.
9. The 3rd Party Server acknowledges the transaction callback by sending a [`TransactionCallbackACK`](/docs/transactioncallbackack) (HTTP 200) to the Nayax Server. At this point, the service can be provided on the Service Station.
10. The Nayax Server sends an `AuthorizationResponse` to the Nayax Device, indicating the outcome of the authorization. The Nayax Device then returns to an idle state.
11. The 3rd Party Server sends a [`Settlement`](/docs/settlement) request to the Nayax Server.
12. The Nayax Server performs the settlement with the Payment Provider and sends a [`SettlementResponse`](/docs/settlementresponse) back to the 3rd Party Server.

## Pre-Selection Flow

To understand the device start pre-selection flow, see the diagram below:

<Frame><img src="/images/docs/spark-remote-start/image2.png" /></Frame>

Below is a breakdown of the diagram:

1. A consumer starts a session on a service station, which sends a [`StartAuthentication`](/docs/startauthentication) request to the Nayax Server via a 3rd Party Server.
2. The Nayax Server responds to the 3rd Party Server with a [`StartAuthentication`](/docs/startauthentication) Response.
3. The 3rd Party Server sends a [`TriggerTransaction`](/docs/triggertransaction) request to the Nayax Server.
4. The Nayax Server sends a "Wake Up" command to the Nayax Device.
5. The Nayax Device responds to the Nayax Server, confirming it has woken up.
6. The Nayax Server sends a [`TriggerTransaction`](/docs/triggertransaction) response back to the 3rd Party Server.
7. The consumer presents their card to the Nayax Device. The Nayax Device then sends an `AuthorizationRequest` to the Nayax Server.
8. The Nayax Server processes transactions by performing sales, authorizations, and settlements with a Payment Provider. Concurrently, it sends a [`TransactionCallback`](/docs/transactioncallback) to the 3rd Party Server.
9. The 3rd Party Server acknowledges the transaction callback by sending a [`TransactionCallback`](/docs/transactioncallback) (HTTP 200) to the Nayax Server. At this point, the service can be provided at the Service Station.
10. The Nayax Server sends an `AuthorizationResponse` to the Nayax Device, indicating the outcome of the authorization. The Nayax Device then returns to an idle state.
