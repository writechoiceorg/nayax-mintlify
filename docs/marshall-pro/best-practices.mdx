### Request IDs
Every request must have a unique identifier.
* **Format**: Alphanumeric with hyphens (e.g., `refuel-12345`).
* **Context**: Include business logic in the ID to make logs easier to read.

### Amount Handling
VPOS uses **minor units** to avoid floating-point errors.
* If `decimalPlace` is 2, **$1.00** is sent as `100`.
* If `decimalPlace` is 3, **$1.00** is sent as `1000`.

### Conventional Timeouts
The client system should manage timeouts to ensure the terminal doesn't hang indefinitely:
| Phase | Suggested Timeout |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Card Detection** | 30–60 Seconds |
| **User Input** | 60–120 Seconds |
| **Authorization** | 10–30 Seconds |

### Error Handling
* **Logging**: Always store the `errorCode` and `errorMessage`.
* **Retries**: Do not retry **DECLINED** transactions. A decline is a final response from the bank; the user must provide a different payment method.
