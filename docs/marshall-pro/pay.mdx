title: "pay"
description: "Process an immediate, single-phase payment transaction."
---

The `pay` method initiates an immediate transaction where detection, authorization, and settlement occur in one continuous flow. Unlike the two-phase fuel workflow, this serves fixed-price sales or "Pay-Inside" scenarios where the final amount is known before the card is presented.

Use this method to:
* Facilitate instant fulfillment for car washes, vacuum stations, or kiosk items where the price remains fixed.
* Simplify integration by removing the need for a separate settlement call.
* Increase throughput in high-traffic environments where users pay a set fee and move on quickly.

## Requests

All requests must include the `command`, `requestId`, and the exact `amount` to be charged. The terminal will activate the reader and wait for the customer to present their payment method.

The following example shows a typical request:
```json
{
"command": "pay",
"requestId": "req-001",
"data": {
"channels": ["CTLS", "CHIP", "SWIPE"],
"amount": 5000,
"volume": 30000,
"product": "Diesel"
}
}

```

| **amount** | integer | Yes | The exact amount to be charged (refer to `decimalPlace`). |
