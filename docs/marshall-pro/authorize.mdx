title: "authorize"
description: "Initiate a financial pre-authorization on a previously detected payment method."
---

The `authorize` method places a financial hold (pre-authorization) on a previously identified card. This represents the second phase of a two-step transaction, occurring after a successful `cardDetect` call.

Use this method to:
* Guarantee payment by reserving a maximum dollar amount before the fueling session begins.
* Verify card validity and fund availability before the pump is activated.
* Capture a final amount that is less than or equal to the initial hold.

Example of the authorization prompt on a Nayax device:

## Requests

This command relies on the card data stored in the terminal's session buffer from the preceding detection phase. Consequently, a `data` object is not required in the request.

The following example shows a typical request:
```json
{
"command": "authorize",
"requestId": "req-002"
}
```

### Parameter Definitions

The table below describes the required fields for the authorization request:

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **command** | string | Yes | Set to `"authorize"`. |
| **requestId** | string | Yes | A unique identifier for tracking the response. |

## Responses

The terminal returns a response after communicating with the financial gateway. A successful response contains the `transactionId`, which is mandatory for the subsequent settlement.

The following example shows a typical response:
```json
{
"requestId": "req-002",
"data": {
"transactionId": "TXN-20260113-003000",
"authorizedAmount": 50000,
"state": "AUTHORIZED",
"cardBrand": "MASTERCARD",
"cardEntryMode": "CHIP",
"maskedPan": "************5678",
"aid": "A0000000031010"
}
}
```
