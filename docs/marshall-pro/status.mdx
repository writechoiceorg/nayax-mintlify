title: "status"
description: "Retrieve the current operational state of the VPOS terminal."
---

The `status` method retrieves the current operational state of the VPOS payment terminal. This endpoint is essential for monitoring hardware readiness before initiating a transaction or checking the progress of a long-running user interaction.

Use this method to:
* Verify the reader is idle and ready before sending a payment command.
* Determine if the terminal is currently waiting for card interaction or processing data.
* Identify if the terminal is offline or in a "not ready" state to track hardware health.

## Requests

Requests for this endpoint are straightforward and do not require a `data` object. You must only provide the standard `command` and a unique `requestId`.

``` json
{
"command": "status",
"requestId": "req-021"
}
```

### Parameter Definitions

The table below describes the common fields required for this request:

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **command** | string | Yes | Set to `"status"`. |
| **requestId** | string | Yes | A unique identifier for tracking the response. |


## Responses

The VPOS terminal returns the current state of the card reader as an integer value.

``` json
{
"requestId": "req-021",
"data": {
"reader": 1
}
}
```

### Reader Values

The `reader` integer shows the current state code of the payment reader hardware.
Use the following table to map its operational meaning:

| Value | State | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | Not Ready | The terminal is offline, disconnected, or initializing. |
| **1** | Ready | The terminal is idle and ready to accept new commands. |
| **2** | Waiting for Card | The reader is active and prompted for a user's payment method. |
| **3** | Processing | A transaction or command is currently being executed. |
