title: "Java SDK Simulator"
---

The Nayax Marshall SDK includes a simulator to help developers test and debug their implementation with the Nayax payment system. The simulator replicates the behavior of the actual hardware and software interactions, allowing you to validate the vending process without needing physical hardware.

## Simulator

When the Java SDK simulator is started on a terminal, its menu will look like this:

<Terminal>
  {`
                    [0]: Start Vend Session 0
          					[1]: Cancel Session
          					[2]: Close Session 0
          					[3]: Info Session
          					[4]: Check balance
                    [5]: query opened sessions
                    [6]: query reader state
                    [7]: cash sale
                    [8]: alert
                    [9]: select brand
                    [10]: transfer custom transaction_id
                    [11]: display message
                    [12]: open socket
                    [13]: close socket
                    [14]: UI control
                    [15]: marshall parser
          					[q]: quit
                  `}
</Terminal>

<HTMLBlock>{`
<style>
pre.bash {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  font-size: medium ; 
  font-family: Consolas,Monaco,Lucida Console,Liberation Mono,DejaVu Sans Mono,Bitstream Vera Sans Mono,Courier New, monospace;
  width: 100%;
  display: inline-block;
}
</style>

<pre class="bash">
[0]: Start Vend Session 0
[1]: Cancel Session
[2]: Close Session 0
[3]: query opened sessions
[4]: query reader state
[5]: cash sale
[6]: alert
[7]: display message
[8]: open socket
[9]: close socket
[10]: UI control

</pre>
`}</HTMLBlock>

The table below describes each option:

## Transaction Flow Examples

Below are examples of the flow for each transaction type:

1. **Regular Transaction** (Single Session):
   1. Start a session: with `[0]: Start session`.
   2. Present card, wait for authorization and "Thank you" screen.
2. **Multi-Session Transaction**:
   1. Start a session with `[0]: Start session 0`.
   2. Present card, wait for authorization and "Thank you" screen.
   3. Close the relevant session- in this case, use `[2]: Close Session 0`.
