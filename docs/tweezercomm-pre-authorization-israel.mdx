Tweezercomm's pre-authorization transactions are processed, authorized, and either settled or canceled based on the response from the payment server. This process also includes a resilience mechanism for handling errors.

## Transaction Flow

To understand the pre-authorization transaction flow, consider the following sequence of events:

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. The client application (POS) sends a `[doTransaction()\`](doc:dotransaction-ashrait) request to the Nayax Device with a parameter (`Trancode=2`) to initiate a pre-authorization.
2. The cardholder inserts, shows, or swipes their card.
3. The Nayax Device communicates with the payment server to perform the pre-authorization.
4. The payment server responds, and the Nayax Device relays the `Authorization result` back to the POS.
5. At a later time, the POS sends another [`doTransaction()`](doc:dotransaction-ashrait) request, this time with a parameter (`Trancode=3`) to initiate the completion of the pre-authorized transaction.
6. The Nayax Device communicates with the payment server to complete the transaction.
7. The payment server responds with a `Completion result`, which the Nayax Device sends back to the POS.
8. At the end of the day, the POS sends a [`doPeriodic()`](doc:doperiodic) request. The Nayax Device communicates with the payment server to perform the settlement of the day's transactions and sends a[`doPeriodic()`](doc:doperiodic) result back to the POS.
