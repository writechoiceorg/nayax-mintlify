title: "Partial Approval in Authorization"
---

This feature allows Payment Gateway to approve a lower authorization amount if the cardholder does not have enough balance to cover the full requested amount, increasing the integration's approval rate.

The partially approved amount is the amount that can be used for purchase and will limit the settlement amount.

## How to implement

In the [Authorization endpoint response](), set the attributes as follows:\
• `Status.Verdict` = Approved\
• `Status .Code` = 0\
•`PaymentInfo. AuthAmount` = Approve amount for pre-authorization.

See the example below:

```json
{"Status": {
	"Verdict": "Approved",
	"Code": 0,},
"PaymentInfo": {
	"AuthAmount": 5}
}
```
