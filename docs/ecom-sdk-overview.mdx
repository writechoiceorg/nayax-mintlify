The Nayax eCom SDK is a tool designed to streamline the integration of e-commerce payment processing for merchants. It acts as an intermediary, simplifying the interaction between your front-end application and various billing providers, allowing you to:

* Accept global and local payment methods.

* Support online payments for web, iOS, and Android.

* Offer payment links.

The SDK abstracts away the complexities of integrating directly with multiple payment gateways. Instead of building custom integrations for each payment provider, merchants integrate once with the Nayax eCom SDK.

## Integration Architecture

A complete online payments integration with eCom consists of the following parts:

1. **Payments server**   : Makes API requests to the eCom API endpoints and receives responses.
2. **Client website or app**   : Our [Drop-in UI](docs:drop-in-ui) collects payment details from the consumer and passes payment information to your server.
3. **Webhook server**   : Receives [webhooks](doc:webhook-notifications) from eCom about payment statuses and other payment-related activity.
