Widgets are visual components that show specific customized data to meet your business needs. You can find these widgets on **Reports > Dashboard**. The Lynx Widget API provides access to these components, allowing you to integrate machine and operator data into your applications.

There are widgets available at two levels:

* **Operator/Actor Level:** Widgets that gather data from multiple machines.
* **Machine Level:** Widgets that show data specific to a single machine.

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  Every widget has its own unique identifier (`widget_type_id`), filters, and other configuration options. See a list of all [Widgets ID List](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/available-widgets).
