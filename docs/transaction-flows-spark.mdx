title: "Payment Flows"
---

Spark supports multiple payment flows to handle different use cases depending on how the payment process is initiated.

* **Remote Start**: The transaction is initiated by the integrator's server remotely, often triggered by a consumer action outside the physical payment device (e.g., plugging in an EV charger).
* **Device Start**: The transaction begins directly from the Nayax payment terminal, where the consumer interacts with the device to select a service point or product.

Each flow involves a specific sequence of API calls and device interactions tailored for either integrator-driven or device-driven control, and  uses a standard set of Spark API methods, such as `StartAuthentication`, `TriggerTransaction`, and `Settlement`. But the timing and responsibility differ depending on the initiator and logic owner. To learn more about each one, see the following pages.
