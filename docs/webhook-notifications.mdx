Webhook notifications are automated messages sent by Nayax to your back-end to communicate the final status of a transaction, which can be:

* Approved
* Declined
* Pending

This ensures that you are always up-to-date with the latest transaction information.

<Note>
**Webhook URL**

You will provide the URL to receive the webhooks during the onboarding phase.
