title: "Network Requirements"

For communication between Nayax and the Integrator, the following methods are supported:

* HTTPS TLS 1.2/1.3
* VPN S2S (Site-to-Site VPN)

If the integrator wishes to establish a VPN tunnel with Nayax server, the VPN tunnels for Test and production will be established during the initial setup stage. The integrator will be asked to complete a VPN request form and join a technical call. During the call, the tunnels will be created and tested. Integration testing will only be performed once the VPN is set up and working.

<Note>
**Authentication with a VPN**

In cases where a VPN is established, the integrator may skip the `Start Session` authentication stage. However, Nayax recommends implementing it in all integrations.

## Whitelist IP's

To ensure smooth communication, the following Nayax public IPs should be whitelisted on the Integrator’s side:

* **Production Servers**:
  * DE (Germany): 137.221.37.126, 185.159.234.2
  * US (United States): 72.28.118.100, 72.28.111.132, 185.159.233.2
  * IL (Israel): 185.159.232.2, 84.110.125.194, 82.102.172.206, 212.179.76.198
* **QA servers**: 31.154.55.2

If required, the Integrator should also allow access from the Nayax QA environment for the Nayax QA team to conduct automation testing.
