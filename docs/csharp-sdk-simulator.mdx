title: "C# SDK Simulator"
---

The Nayax Marshall SDK includes a simulator to help developers test and debug their device integration with the Nayax payment system. The simulator replicates the behaviour of the actual hardware and software interactions, allowing you to validate the vending process without needing physical hardware.

## Simulator

When the C# SDK simulator is started on a terminal, its menu will look like this:

<pre class="bash">
[0]: start session 0
[1]: close session 0
[2]: info session
[3]: cancel session
[4]: query sessions
[5]: reader state
[6]: cash sale
[7]: alert
[8]: transfer custom transaction_id
[9]: brand config
[10]: ftp socket test
[11]: screen control
[12]: link stats
[13]: quit
</pre>

Where:

## Transaction Flow Examples

Below are examples of the flow for each transaction type:

1. **Regular Transaction** (Single Session):
   1. Start a session: with `[0]: Start session`.
   2. Present card, wait for authorization and "Thank you" screen.
2. **Multi-Session Transaction**:
   1. Start a session with `[0]: Start session 0`.
   2. Present card, wait for authorization and "Thank you" screen.
   3. Close the relevant session- in this case, use `[1]: Close Session 0`.
