This page provides access to essential certification files, API testing tools, and documentation that support your integration and validation of TweezerComm services.

## Certification Files

These Excel files are required for certification with various payment scenarios. Download and use them during your implementation and certification process:

* [Pre-Selection Certification](https://docs-engine.modularity.co.il/_static/Retail_Certification_preSelection.xlsx) : Validates terminal behavior before transaction authorization.
* [Pre-Authorization Certification](https://docs-engine.modularity.co.il/_static/Retail_Certification_preAuthorization.xlsx): Verifies transaction handling up to the authorization phase

## Agamento Documentation

The [Agamento User Manual](https://docs-engine.modularity.co.il/_static/Agamentoguidapp_v1.pdf)  is a comprehensive guide for using the Agamento payment application, including configuration, transaction flow, and troubleshooting tips.

## IPs and Ports

In cases where the IT environment has a firewall or IP whitelist, you will need to open a list of IP addresses and Ports, so that you can use TweezerComm. You can see this list in the file below:

* [IP & Port List]()
