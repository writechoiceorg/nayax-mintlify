This article provides a centralized jumping-off point for testing the Nayax EMV Core demo applications. Nayax provides a demo app to help you validate hardware communication and transaction flows from day one of your integration, ensuring your environment is correctly configured before you begin custom development.

### Why Start with Demo Apps?

* **Immediate Validation:** Confirm that your card reader and host system are communicating correctly without writing new code.
* **Reference Code:** Use the demo source code as a blueprint for implementing your own payment logic.
* **Gateway Testing:** Verify connectivity to the Nayax gateway and process test transactions in a controlled environment.
