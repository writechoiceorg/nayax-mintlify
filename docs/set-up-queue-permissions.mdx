Having created the queue in the previous step, the next task is configuring permissions to manage access. This involves creating a policy, setting up user access, and assigning the policy to the created user. Policies define the actions allowed on the queue and are crucial for controlling access to your AWS resources.

## Manage Access to AWS Resources

To begin configuring access to your queue, you first need:

1. Click the **three lines** icon located in the upper left corner of the AWS console.
2. Select the **All services** option.
3. Search the **Security, Identify, & Compliance** category and select **IAM** (Identity and Access Management).
