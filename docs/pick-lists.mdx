A Pick List in Nayax is a generated list of products that need to be restocked or replenished in a specific vending machine or inventory location. It is designed to simplify restocking by identifying the required products and their quantities, ensuring that vending machines are always fully stocked and operational.

In Nayax Core, you can create pick lists following the steps below:

1. In your Dashboard, go to **Operations > Inventory Dashboard**.
2. Use the search filter to look for your desired machine.
3. Right-click the machine and select **Pick List > Generate Pick List**.

This will generate the list of the machines you choose.

<Note>
**Pick List for Multiple Machines**

Nayax Core allows you to generate the pick list for more than one machine, for example if you want to generate the pick list for all the machines under a specific Route, follow the steps below:

1. Add the filter to the search feature.
2. Select all the machines in the list (you can also individually select the machines you want).
3. Click **Actions > Generate Pick List**
