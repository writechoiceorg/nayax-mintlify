The Nayax integration process ensures a seamless and efficient implementation, providing technical support at every stage. From initial setup to production deployment, Nayax teams work closely with partners or customer developers to meet all technical and operational requirements.

## Stages of the process

The integration process is divided into four main stages:

1. [Integration Setup](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/integration-process#integration-setup)
2. [Development Phase](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/integration-process#development-phase)
3. [Testing & Certification](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/integration-process#testing--certification)
4. [Production Setup](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/integration-process#production-setup)

Each stage is structured to provide technical support and essential resources, ensuring smooth and efficient implementation.

### Integration Setup

This initial stage establishes the technical foundation for the integration.

1. **Assignment of Integration Engineer:** A Nayax integration engineer is assigned as the primary focal point for the partner or customer developer.
2. **Configuration:** The engineer configures the Nayax Core (backend) and sets up the device with the relevant transaction flow in the integration environment.
3. **Welcome Email:** At the end of this phase, the engineer sends a welcome email with all necessary resources, including the URL, SDK, documentation, tokens, and other required development tools.

### Development Phase

This stage focuses on the partner or customer developing their solution.

1. **Partner/Customer Development:** The partner or customer developer creates their solution using the Nayax API/SDK.
2. **Support:** During this phase, the integration engineer provides assistance for any issues or "how-to" queries to ensure progress.

<Note>
**Support for OCPP/OCPI Integrations**

For integrations based on **OCPP/OCPI** standards, this step i snot relevant , as these integrations follow predefined flows according to the standard protocol..
</Note>

### Testing & Certification

This stage verifies that the integration meets Nayax’s standards:

1. **Certification Test Requirements:** Nayax shares specific requirements for certification tailored to the integration type and transaction flow.
2. **Testing:** The partner or customer developer performs a series of tests (typically 9–15, depending on the integration type and flow).
3. **Review:** The Nayax integration engineer reviews the results of these tests to ensure all criteria are met.
4. **Certification:** Upon successfully completing all tests, Nayax issues a certification letter confirming the integration is ready for deployment.

### Production Setup

The final stage ensures a smooth deployment in a live environment:

1. **Production Environment Configuration:** Nayax configures the integration in the production environment, including the machine model setup.
2. **Support for Testing:** The integration engineer provides support during production lab or field tests to confirm successful deployment.

The Nayax integration process provides a structured, step-by-step approach that ensures reliable and efficient implementation. By collaborating closely with partners and customers, Nayax delivers high-quality solutions that meet industry standards and support successful deployments in the market.
