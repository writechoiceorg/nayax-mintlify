title: "Testing & Troubleshooting"
---

Once your implementation is complete, it is critical to verify the security of your endpoint. Use the following test cases and troubleshooting guide to ensure a robust integration.

### Test Cases

To confirm your validation logic is functional, do the following checks:

* Confirm that requests with valid HMAC signatures are accepted and processed.
* Verify that requests with incorrect or missing HMACs are rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` status.
* Manually modify a single character in the payload and verify that the HMAC is invalidated and the request is rejected.

### Troubleshooting Validation

If your calculated hash does not match the one provided by Nayax, do the following checks:

* Confirm your secret key matches the one provided to your Nayax Architect and ensure you aren't accidentally using a "Test" key in a "Production" environment.
* Ensure the fields are concatenated in the exact order defined by the Nayax implementation. Remember that the hash is sensitive to sequence.
* Ensure you are using UTF-8 string encoding and that you haven't stripped or added extra whitespace or delimiter characters.
* Review the `HmacService` class in the `SDK.Api.Contracts` library as the "source of truth" for the calculation logic.
