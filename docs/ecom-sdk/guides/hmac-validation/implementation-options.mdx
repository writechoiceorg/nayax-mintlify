title: "Implementation Options"
---

To integrate HMAC validation, you can either leverage the official Nayax SDK or implement the logic manually in your preferred language.

These are the two options for implementation:

### Nayax SDK (C# Developers)

C# developers can use the `SDK.Api.Contracts` library, which includes built-in HMAC validation functionality.

These are the steps:

1. **Install the library**: Run `Install-Package SDK.Api.Contracts`.
2. **Use the HMAC Service**: Utilize the `HmacService` class, which handles all HMAC calculation and validation logic automatically.

### Custom Implementation (Non-C# Developers)

If you are not using C#, you should replicate the logic found in the Nayax SDK:

* **Reference Library**: `SDK.Api.Contracts`
* **Reference Class**: `HmacService`
* **Key Functions**: `CalculateHmac()` and `ValidateHmac()`

## Security Best Practices

To keep your HMAC secret and webhook integration secure, follow these guidelines:

| DO                                                            | DON'T                       |
| :------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| Store in environment variables                                | Hardcode in the source code |
| Use secrets management (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) | Commit to version control   |
| Restrict access to production keys                            | Share via email or chat     |
| Always validate HMAC before processing notifications          | Log keys in error messages  |
