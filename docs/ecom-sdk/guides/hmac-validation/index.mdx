title: "HMAC Validation"
---

To ensure the integrity and authenticity of webhook notifications, Nayax uses Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC). This mechanism allows you to verify that incoming data was sent by Nayax and has not been altered in transit.

Before you can begin validating requests, you must coordinate a one-time setup with your Nayax Professional Services Solution Architect.

The HMAC key creation follows these steps:

1. Create a unique HMAC secret key. with a hexadecimal string of at least 32 characters.
2. Provide this key to your Nayax Architect.
3. Confirm the following technical specifications with your Architect:
   * **Field Order:** The exact sequence of payload fields used for the hash.
   * **Encoding:** The string encoding format (standard is **UTF-8**).
   * **Delimiters:** The specific characters used to separate fields in the payload.
4. Store your secret key securely (e.g., in an environment variable). Never hardcode it in your source code.

Once the setup is complete, the verification process follows these steps:

1. Nayax generates a hash by combining the notification data with your secret key.
2. Nayax sends the webhook with the signature included in the headers or payload.
3. Your application receives the webhook and recalculates the hash using your local secret key.
4. If your calculated hash matches the one sent by Nayax, the request is authentic.

<Danger>
  **Important:** If the hashes do not match, the request should be treated as unauthorized and discarded. Always validate the HMAC before processing any notification.
