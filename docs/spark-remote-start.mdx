title: "Remote Start"
---

In the Remote Start Flow, your remote server initiates the transaction, directing Nayax to activate a specific device. This method is particularly suited for scenarios where the transaction begins from an application or a computer, rather than directly at the Nayax terminal.

The Remote Start flows use the following Spark methods:

* [`StartAuthentication`](doc:startauthentication)
* [`TriggerTransaction`](doc:triggertransaction)
* [`TransactionCallback`](doc:transactioncallback)
* [`Settlement`](doc:settlement)
* [`CancelTransaction`](doc:canceltransaction)
* [`TimeoutCallback`](doc:timeoutcallback)
* [`DeclineCallback`](doc:declinecallback)

<Note>
**Payment Flows**

Remote Start supports both pre-authorization and pre-selection transaction flows. The sections below provide a more detailed breakdown of each flow..
</Note>

## Pre-Authorization Flow

To understand the device start pre-authorization flow, see the diagram below:

Below is a breakdown of the diagram:

1. A consumer starts a session on a service station, which sends a [`StartAuthentication`](doc:startauthentication) request to the Nayax Server via a 3rd Party Server.
2. The Nayax Server responds to the 3rd Party Server with a [`StartAuthenticationResponse`](doc:startauthenticationresponse).
3. The 3rd Party Server sends a [`TriggerTransaction`](doc:triggertransaction) request to the Nayax Server.
4. The Nayax Server sends a "Wake Up" command to the Nayax Device.
5. The Nayax Device responds to the Nayax Server, confirming it has woken up.
6. The Nayax Server sends a [`TriggerTransactionResponse`](doc:triggertransactionresponse) back to the 3rd Party Server.
7. The consumer presents their card to the Nayax Device. The Nayax Device then sends an [`AuthorizationRequest`](doc:authorizationrequest) to the Nayax Server.
8. The Nayax Server performs authorization with a Payment Provider and sends a [`TransactionCallback`](doc:transactioncallback) to the 3rd Party Server.
9. The 3rd Party Server acknowledges the transaction callback by sending a [`TransactionCallbackACK`](doc:transactioncallbackack) (HTTP 200) to the Nayax Server. At this point, the service can be provided on the Service Station.
10. The Nayax Server sends an `AuthorizationResponse` to the Nayax Device, indicating the outcome of the authorization. The Nayax Device then returns to an idle state.
11. The 3rd Party Server sends a [`Settlement`](doc:settlement) request to the Nayax Server.
12. The Nayax Server performs the settlement with the Payment Provider and sends a [`SettlementResponse`](doc:settlementresponse) back to the 3rd Party Server.

## Pre-Selection Flow

To understand the device start pre-selection flow, see the diagram below:

Below is a breakdown of the diagram:

1. A consumer starts a session on a service station, which sends a [`StartAuthentication`](doc:startauthentication) request to the Nayax Server via a 3rd Party Server.
2. The Nayax Server responds to the 3rd Party Server with a [`StartAuthentication`](doc:startauthentication) Response.
3. The 3rd Party Server sends a [`TriggerTransaction`](doc:triggertransaction) request to the Nayax Server.
4. The Nayax Server sends a "Wake Up" command to the Nayax Device.
5. The Nayax Device responds to the Nayax Server, confirming it has woken up.
6. The Nayax Server sends a [`TriggerTransaction`](doc:triggertransaction) response back to the 3rd Party Server.
7. The consumer presents their card to the Nayax Device. The Nayax Device then sends an `AuthorizationRequest` to the Nayax Server.
8. The Nayax Server processes transactions by performing sales, authorizations, and settlements with a Payment Provider. Concurrently, it sends a [`TransactionCallback`](doc:transactioncallback) to the 3rd Party Server.
9. The 3rd Party Server acknowledges the transaction callback by sending a [`TransactionCallback`](doc:transactioncallback) (HTTP 200) to the Nayax Server. At this point, the service can be provided at the Service Station.
10. The Nayax Server sends an `AuthorizationResponse` to the Nayax Device, indicating the outcome of the authorization. The Nayax Device then returns to an idle state.
