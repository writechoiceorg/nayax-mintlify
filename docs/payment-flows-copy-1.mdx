title: "Global Payment Flows"

TweezerComm follows structured payment flows to ensure secure and efficient transaction processing. These flows define how different transaction types, such as regular payments, pre-authorizations, and deferred payments, are handled within the system. Understanding these flows enables client applications to integrate appropriately with the Nayax Gateway and optimize payment processing capabilities.

The pages below provide a more detailed description of each one:
