The `getRetailerInfo` method allows the client application to verify the merchant (retailer) name and ID associated with the device. This can be used after the establishment process (process done by Nayax's team) or client setup to confirm that the correct merchant information such as the ID and name provided by the ABS (Shva) has been configured.
