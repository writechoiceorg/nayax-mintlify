title: "On Screen QR Display"
---

Each device has a QR code generated by default, which includes its device ID. The QR code may be displayed on the screen in idle mode or as a carousel, among other payment methods, cycling on the VPOS screen. A logo of your brand could also be added alongside the QR. The mobile application backend should perform the Cortina calls with the device ID extracted from the QR image. Extracting the device ID from the entire QR string should be performed by the mobile application or its backend.

See the image below for an example.
