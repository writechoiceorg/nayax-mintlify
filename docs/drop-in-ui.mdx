title: "Drop-in UI"
---

The Drop-in UI component allows you to easily display a complete, pre-configured list of available Payment Methods anywhere on your website, minimizing development time for integration.

Other features of the UI include:

* Payment method additions are instantly available with no development required.
* Complete styling control over the payment method list.
* Native 3D Secure 2 support is included.

<Note>
**Implement Drop-in UI**

The `startPayment` method automatically handles the implementation of the Drop-in UI.

## How it Works

The Drop-in usage flow is as follows:

1. The consumer goes to the checkout page.
2. This creates an instance of Drop-in using the session data from the server.
3. The Drop-in shows the available payment methods and collects the consumer's payment details.

4. Once the payment is performed, the UI will present the payment result to the consumer.

<Note>
**Webhook Notification**

Your webhook server simultaneously receives the event containing the payment outcome. See [Webhook Notifications](doc:webhook-notifications) for more details.
</Note>

### Field Validation

If the consumer enters incorrect information in the fields, the drop-in UI performs a validation check and informs them of the errors. See the example below:
