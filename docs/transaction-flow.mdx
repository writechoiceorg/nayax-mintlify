The SDK supports multiple transaction flows to accommodate diverse use cases, from single-step payments to multi-step preauthorization and confirmation processes. This flexibility allows developers to choose the flow best suits their application's requirements while maintaining security and reliability.

The available transaction flows are:

  <Card title="Payment with Pre-Authorization" href="/v1.0/docs/payment-with-authorization" icon="arrow-up-right">
    A two-step process where a transaction amount is preauthorized before being confirmed for settlement. Ideal for scenarios where the exact final amount is unknown (such as EV charging).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Closed Loop Transaction" href="/v1.0/docs/closed-loop-transaction" icon="arrow-up-right">
    Closed-loop transactions refer to operations using MIFARE cards. A MIFARE card UID is used to process the operations in their application server, which does not involve bank transactions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Single Step Payment" href="/v1.0/docs/single-step-payment" icon="arrow-up-right">
    The single-step payment flow allows for immediate authorization and settlement in one operation, streamlining the payment process for use cases that require fast, straightforward transactions.
