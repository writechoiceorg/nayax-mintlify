title: "Deferred Payment"

The Deferred transaction flow processes a payment request in two distinct phases:

1. A Pre-Authorization phase
2. A final Authorization and Settlement phase

This two-step approach is particularly useful for transactions where the final amount or details may change after the initial card interaction.

## Transaction Flow

To understand the Deferred transaction flow, consider the following sequence of events:

<Note>
  Steps insisde the green area are performed online, and the ones inside the red area are performed offline.

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. After the client application (POS) performs its [`doPeriodic()` ](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/doperiodic) to settle the stored card transactions.
2. `setConfig()` Will switch the device to work in deferred mode, using offline mode.
3. The pos send a [`doTransaction()`](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/dotransaction-ashrait) request to the Nayax Device, triggering a new transaction.
4. The CardHolder taps their contactless card.
5. The Nayax Device checks for "Deferred pre-conditions" and, upon approval, returns the transaction result as `Approved->Pending` This means the transaction is approved.
   <Note>
     Once the deferred mode is finished working, continue to step 6.
   </Note>
6. The client application calls `setConfig()` Setting off-line mode to false.
7. The client application calls the `authorizePendingTransactions()` , sending the pending transactions to Nayax's device asking to settling them (but no settlement is performed yet).
8. The Nayax Device communicates with SHVA to initiate the pending transaction authorization.
9. The transaction results are returned to the Device.
10. The transaction results are returned to the client application.
11. The flow concludes with a final [`doPeriodic()`](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/doperiodic) call from the client application, to settle all authorized transactions.
