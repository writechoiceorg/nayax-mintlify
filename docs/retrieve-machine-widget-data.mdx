The Lynx Widget API provides access to widget data. In this article, you will learn how to retrieve widget information using API calls, from listing all available widgets to obtaining data from a specific widget.

## Prerequisites

Before making calls to the Widget API, you need to have:

* Access to the Lynx QA or Production environment
* A valid API token (See [Security & Token](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/security))
* [Machines](https://developerhub.nayax.com/reference/machines) or [Operator](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/operator) IDs

## Available Endpoints

The Widget API offers two main endpoints:
