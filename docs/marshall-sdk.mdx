The Marshall Protocol is a proprietary communication protocol developed by Nayax that works over RS232 connectivity. Designed as a robust communication protocol, it accommodates reliable transaction exchange between a machine controller and the VPOST, ONYX, and VPOSM line of products. It provides a very rich payment API that supports various payment flows, such as:

* Pre-selection
* Pre-authorization
* Multi-session
* Multi-vending

The Marshall SDK provides a straightforward and comprehensive approach to leverage these flows, eliminating the need to manage the details of the Marshall protocol.

**Available Languages**

For your convenience, the SDK is provided in C, C#, and JAVA.

## System Overview

The diagram below illustrates the transaction and communication flow of the Nayax system.

Below is a breakdown of the diagram:

* At the core is the Nayax device, which manages transactions. This device communicates with Nayax payment and monitoring servers for transaction processing, which, in turn, interact with banks or payment gateways to finalize payments.
* The blue arrows indicate the primary transaction flow between the Nayax device server and banks.
* The host machine communicates with the VPOS over the Marshall protocol.
