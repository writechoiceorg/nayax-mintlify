Cards serve as versatile solutions for various business needs, such as facilitating payments, issuing refunds, providing discounts, or granting access to services. This page will guide you through creating a card with Lynx API and how to verify it in Nayax Core.

## Card Types

Nayax offers several types of cards, each designed for a distinct purpose:

* **Prepaid Card**: Preloaded with funds, prepaid cards are ideal for controlled spending. They are commonly used for gift cards, employee stipends, or consumer transactions and offer convenience and security. This
* **Technician Card**: Issued to service technicians or employees, these cards facilitate access to specific systems or authorize work-related transactions, ensuring secure operations in the field.
* **Refund Card**: Designed to process refunds, these cards efficiently return funds to customers, simplifying financial workflows and enhancing customer satisfaction.
* **Discount Card**: Used in loyalty programs or promotional campaigns, discount cards offer exclusive benefits like reduced prices or special offers, encouraging customer retention and engagement.

In this guide we will be showing API request creating a prepaid card, but all of them can be created in the same way.

## Card Creation

To create a new virtual credit card with Lynx API you can use the **POST** method on two different endpoints:
<Columns cols={2}>
<EndpointCard
  title="V1: Create Virtual Card"
  href="/reference/create-virtual-card"
  method="post"
/>

<EndpointCard
  title="V2: Create New Card"
  href="/reference/create-new-card"
  method="post"
/>
</Columns>

<Warning>
**Authentication**

Refer to the [Security & Token](/docs/security) page of this documentation to learn how to access your tokens, and how to properly use it to authenticate your API requests.
</Warning>

The sections below will guide you through creating a card using any of these options through Lynx API.

### V1 endpoint

The V1 option is more straightforward, with only the essential fields for basic card creation and minimal optional fields. To create the card, send a **POST** request to the [Create Virtual Card](/reference/create-virtual-card) endpoint, filling in the card details in the body parameters. See the example in the code block below:

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://qa-lynx.nayax.com/operational/v1/cards \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '

## Verifying the card in Nayax Core

Once you send the request to create the card using any endpoints mentioned above, you can go to Nayax Core and check if the card is present in the **Card Management** screen. Follow the steps below to do so.

1. Access your Nayax Core Dashboard
2. On the top menu, navigate to **Consumers > Card Management**

   <Frame><img src="/images/docs/create-cards/image1.png" /></Frame>
3. Now, you can search for the created card and select it from the list.

   <Frame><img src="/images/docs/create-cards/image2.png" /></Frame>

The card created through the Lynx API is available in the Nayax Core, confirming it was successfully created.

<Note>
  the `ExternalApplicationUserID `field won't appear in Nayax Core, but it would appear when using the **GET** method of the [cards ](/reference/get-cards)endpoint.
