title: "Incremental Authorization"

Incremental authorization is a payment feature that allows a merchant to request additional funds on a previously authorized transaction without requiring the customer to re-enter their payment credentials.

<Note>
**Enable Incremental Authorization**

Incremental Authorization requires additional configuration on the Nayax side. If you wish to support it, please contact your assigned Nayax integration engineer.

## How to implement

After a successful Authorization, if the merchant asks for Incremental, your endpoint will receive one or more [Cortina Credit Card Incremental Auth](ref:post_cortina-creditcard-incrementalauth) request, the `BasicInfo.Amount` in this request will be the incremental amount. The `PaymentInfo` object will include the details for the linked authorization.

The Response for this request is similar to a regular Authorization response. The final settlement amount will be sent in the Cortina Credit Card Settlement request in the `BasicInfo.Amount` field.
