Unlike the two-phase model, the Single-phase transaction flow for the SHVA payment service processes and authorizes a payment request in a single, continuous sequence. This streamlined approach is used for regular payments where no intermediate user interaction is required.

## Transaction Flow

To understand the single-phase transaction flow, consider the following sequence of events:

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. The client application (labeled as DC) initiates the transaction by sending a [`doTransaction` ](dotransaction-ashrait)request to the Nayax Device.
2. The Nayax Device prompts the CardHolder to present their card by inserting, showing, or swiping it.
3. The Nayax Device sends an authorization request to the Payment Server.
4. The Payment Server processes the request and sends an Authorization response back to the Nayax Device.
5. The Nayax Device relays the Authorization response to the DC, completing the payment portion of the flow.
6. At the end of the day, the DC sends a [`doPeriodic`](doc:doperiodic) request to the Nayax Device, which then communicates with SHVA to complete the day's batch process. The Nayax Device sends a [`doPeriodic`](doc:doperiodic) response back to the DC.
