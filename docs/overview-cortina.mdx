Cortina API allows third-party integrators, such as payment providers or Payment Gateways, to process payment transactions securely and efficiently. It acts as a communication layer that enables Nayax’s devices to interact with external payment platforms through well-defined request/response flows.

## Transaction Flow Components

Cortina API is the central layer in the payment flow, ensuring that transactions are valid, secure, and processed.

The flow involves four key components:

1. **Customer**: Customers initiate payment by presenting their payment method at the POS (Point of Sale) terminal.
2. **POS (Point of Sale)**: The POS terminal receives the credit card details and the transaction amount. It then sends the card and transaction details to the Nayax server for further processing.
3. **Nayax**: Nayax receives the payment request and uses the Cortina API to verify the transaction. The API handles the transaction's authentication, authorization, and final settlement.
4. **Payment Gateway**: The Payment Gateway processes transaction details, authorizes payments, and clears funds.

Nayax uses the Cortina API to authorize and clear the transaction, ensuring that the payment is valid and is processed securely.
