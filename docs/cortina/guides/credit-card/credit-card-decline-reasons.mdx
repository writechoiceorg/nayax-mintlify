title: "Credit Card Decline Reasons"
---

When a transaction is declined, the Cortina API returns a specific decline reason code that explains why the payment was not approved. These codes are essential for integrators and merchants to understand the cause of the decline and take appropriate action. The third-party integrator is responsible for returning the response, including the corresponding decline code from the list, based on the payment method used.

The following decline reason codes are used when processing Credit Card transactions:

| **Code** | **Description**                                                                    |
