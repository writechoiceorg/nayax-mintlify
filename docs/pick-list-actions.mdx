In Nayax core, various actions can be taken regarding pick lists, such as updating, deleting, or retrieving a pick list from a machine. All of these are performed in the **Operations > Machine Inventory** menu.

These actions can also be performed through Lynx API using the following endpoints:

## Get Pick List from Machine

You can retrieve the pick list associated with a specific machine using the [Get Pick List](https://developerhub.nayax.com/reference/get-pick-list) endpoint. See the example request below:

```curl Request
curl --request GET \
     --url https://qa-lynx.nayax.com/operational/v1/machines/{MachineID}/pickList \
     --header 'Authorization: BEARER-TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

<Note>
**Path Param**

Change `MachineID` with the actual ID of the machine to retrieve the pick list from.
</Note>

A successful response will return the pick list with all the products available on the machine.

## Update Pick List

You can modify the pick list for a specific machine using the [Update Pick List](https://developerhub.nayax.com/reference/update-pick-list) endpoint. This endpoint allows you to update the quantities of products to be restocked or adjust other details in the pick list. See the example request below:

```curl Request
curl --request PUT \
     --url https://qa-lynx.nayax.com/operational/v1/machines/inventory/picklists/update \
     --header 'Authorization: BEARER-TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
       "MachineId": 12345,
       "Products": [
         {
           "MachineProductId": 67890,
           "PickQty": 10
         },
         {
           "MachineProductId": 54321,
           "PickQty": 5
         }
       ]
     }'
```

Where:

<table align={["left","left","left"]}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Parameter
      </th>

      <th>
        Type
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **MachineId**
      </td>

      <td>
        `int64`
      </td>

      <td>
        The unique identifier of the machine whose pick list is being updated.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **Products**
      </td>

      <td>
        `array of objects`
      </td>

      <td>
        A list of products to be updated in the pick list:
        `MachineProductId`: The unique identifier of the product in the machine.
        `PickQty`The updated quantity of the product to be picked.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

A successful response will return the pick list with the updated pick quantities.

## Delete Pick List

Using the [Delete Pick List](https://developerhub.nayax.com/reference/delete-pick-list) endpoint, you can remove the existing pick list associated with a specific machine. This endpoint helps operators clear outdated or incorrect pick lists to ensure accurate restocking processes.

```curl Request
curl --request DELETE \
     --url https://qa-lynx.nayax.com/operational/v1/machines/{MachineID}/pickList \
     --header 'Authorization: BEARER-TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

A successful request will return the confirmation of the deletion of the pick list.
