title: "Resilience Mechanism"
---

TweezerComm has a resilience mechanism for handling transaction completion or cancellation in case of errors or failures. Whenever an error occurs, such as a `statusCode != 0`  TweezerComm will automatically fall back to this mechanism, ensuring that transactions are completed successfully or through retries and verification steps to prevent inconsistencies. 

## How it Works

The flow chart describes the flow of the mechanism.

When a transaction requires completion (settlement) or cancellation, and the system verifies whether a response has been received, the flow can vary depending on the reaction.

* If a response was received,  the system proceeds to check the `StatusCode`. If it  is equal to `0`, it will finish the completion process, else it will trigger the retry mechanism.
* If no response is received, the system retrieves transaction details using the `getTransactionByVuid()` method. 
  * To check if the transaction is finalized, the system evaluates  if `IsFinalAmount=1 ` and `TransactionDeposited=1/2`.
  * If they are not equal to those values, the system triggers the retry mechanism.

The process continuously loops back to the start of the Completion/Cancel flow, ensuring that it continues until a definitive success or failure condition is reached.
