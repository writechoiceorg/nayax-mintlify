title: "Front-End Integration"
---

The front-end SDK enables you to integrate a payment page into your applications without directly handling complex payment processing or security. It simplifies the front-end payment experience by providing a few key methods that handle the secure display and interaction with the payment page. At the same time, Nayax manages the complex interactions with the billing provider in the background.

## Payment Flow

The diagram below describes the typical payment flow for a front-end integration.

Here's the breakdown of the diagram:

1. The process begins with an [`Initialize`](ref:post_initialize) request from your front-end to the eCom SDK.
2. The eCom SDK sends this request to the Nayax Server.
3. The server responds with the Session Data.
4. The eCom SDK will then present the Drop-In UI to the Front-end
5. The Consumer enters payment data, which triggers a [`startPayment`](docs:ecom-sdk-create-payments) request to the eCom SDK.
6. An "Auth" request is sent from eCom SDK to the Nayax Server.
7. Nayax Server responds with 'Approved' back to the eCom SDK.
8. Once approved, your Back-end receives an Approved (HTTP 200) message via webhook.
