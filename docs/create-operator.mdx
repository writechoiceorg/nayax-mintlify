   2. **Parent**: Refers to the parent actor for this new operator, which, in this example, is the distributor itself.
   3. **Type**: The operator type.
   4. **Status**: The status of the operator.
   5. **Regional Settings**: Configuration regarding currency and timezone.
4. When finished, click **Save Information**.

<Warning>
**Actor Types**

Note that when you create an actor directly below the distributor, there are only two types available: Institute or Operator. To create Routes, Area, or Location actor types, they must be below an actor with the Operator type.
</Warning>

## Lynx API

This process can also be done programmatically through Lynx API with a POST request to the following endpoint:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title={
      <div class="card_content">
        <h3><span class="post">post</span> Create New Actor</h3>
      </div>
    }
    href="/reference/create-new-actor"
  />
</CardGroup>
