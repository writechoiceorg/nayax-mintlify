title: "Present cardholder Balance on the Terminal"
---

This feature allows Payment Gateway to report the cardholder's prepaid balance remaining after the current transaction, which is shown to the user at the end of the transaction.

## How to Implement

In the Settlement endpoint response  or at the Sale endpoint response, set the Balance object as follows:

* `RegularCreditType` = 1
* `RegularCredit `= Balance amount.

See the example below:

```json
{"Balance": {
  "RegularCreditType": 1,
  "RegularCredit": 50.0}
```
