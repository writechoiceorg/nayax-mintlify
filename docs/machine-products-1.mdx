Mapping products to machines, also known as planogram setup, is a critical step in inventory management. This process involves assigning specific products to the bins or selections of a vending machine and defining the machine's layout. A well-structured planogram ensures that the correct products are available in the right quantities, providing clear guidance for inventory tracking and restocking.

You can create product maps in Nayax Core by following the steps below:

1. Go to **Administration > Product Maps**.
2. Click **Add New Product Map**
3. Fill in the required fields for the product map.
   1. **Operator Name**: Specify under which operator the map will be located.
   2. **Machine Model**: Select which machine the map is for.
   3. **Map Name**
   4. **Status**: Whether the map is active or not.
4. Click **Save**

Now, you can add products to this map. Follow the steps below to do so:

1. Select the Map from the list.
2. Click on the Map Items tab.
3. Now you can add a product to this map by clicking:
   1. **Add BIN**: This will let you add one product directly to the list.
   2. **Add Multiple BINS**: This will bring a pop-up window that will let you select multiple products to add to the map.

  <Card
    title={
      <div class="card_content">
        <h3><span class="post">post</span> Create Machine Products</h3>
      </div>

### Add Machine Product

the [Create Machine Products]()  endpoint allows you to create the product map for a machine and add products to it by providing the `MachineID` in the path param of the request. See the example request in the code block below:

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://qa-lynx.nayax.com/operational/v1/machines/{MachineID}/machineProducts \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
[
  {
    "NayaxProductID": 0,
    "MDBCode": 0,
    "PAR": 0,
    "CashPrice": 0,
    "CreditCardPrice": 0,
    "MachinePrice": 0,
    "RetailPrice": 0,
    "DEXProductName": "string",
    "PACode": "string",
    "PCCode": "string",
    "ProductMinimumPickQTY": 0,
    "VendOutAlertThreshold": 0,
    "PrePaidCardPrice": 0,
    "OperatorButtonCode": "string",
    "CommissionValue": 0,
    "ExternalPrepaidPrice": 0
  }
]
'
```

You can add more than one product object in the array. This way, you can add multiple products to the Map with juust one request.
