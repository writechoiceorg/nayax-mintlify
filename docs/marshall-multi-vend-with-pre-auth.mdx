title: "Multi-Vend with Pre-Auth"
---

In the Multi-Vend with Pre-Authorization flow, you first authorize a customer's payment card before they select any products for the highest amount you'd be willing to charge them. Once payment is approved and the session begins, the customer can select and receive multiple products within that single session without needing separate authorization for each selection.

This flow streamlines the transaction by consolidating authorization for multiple items into one initial step.

## Payment Flow

The diagram below illustrates the complete sequence of events for a Multi-Vend with Pre-Authorization transaction.

Below is a breakdown of the diagram:

1. The consumer presents the card to the Nayax Device.
2. The Nayax Device sends an authorization request to the Nayax Server.
3. The Nayax Server forwards the authorization request to the Billing Provider.
4. The billing Provider sends an authorization response (approved) to the Nayax Server.
5. Nayax Server sends the authorization response (approved) back to the Nayax Device.
6. The peripheral's SDK begins the session and triggers the "session begin" event:
   ```c
   vmc_vend_event_handler_cb(vm_vend_event_on_session_begin)
   ```
   ```csharp
   vend_callbacks(onBeginSession(funds_avail))
   ```
   ```java
   vmc_vend_events()
   (via onBeginSession(funds_avail))
   ```
7. Message to the consumer: "Please Select a Product."
8. The consumer selects the desired product/s from the vending machine. Said products are being added to a list called "session":
   ```c C
   session_products[0].code = 1;
   session_products[0] .qty = 1;
   session_products[0].price = 10;
   session_products[0].unit = 1;

   session_products[1].code = 2;
   session_products[1].qty = 1;
   session_products[1].price = 20;
   session_products[1].unit = 1;
   if (config.multi_vend_support)
   {
   	session->products = session_products;
     session->total_products = 2;
   }
   ```
   ```csharp C#
   List<vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t> list = new List<vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t>();

   list.Add(new vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t((ushort)1, (ushort)10, (ushort)1, (byte)1));
   list.Add(new vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t((ushort)2, (ushort)20, (ushort)2, (byte)1));
   list.Add(new vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t((ushort)3, (ushort)30, (ushort)3, (byte)1));

   // prepare single session object
   session = new vmc_vend_t.vend_session_t(list);
   ```
   ```java
   	ArrayList<vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t> list = new ArrayList<vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t>();

     list.add(new vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t((short) 0, (short) 100, (short) 1, (byte) 1));
     list.add(new vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t((short) 1, (short) 100, (short) 1, (byte) 1));
     list.add(new vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t((short) 2, (short) 200, (short) 2, (byte) 1));
     list.add(new vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t((short) 3, (short) 100, (short) 1, (byte) 1));
     list.add(new vmc_vend_t.vend_item_t((short) 4, (short) 200, (short) 2, (byte) 1));

     // in this sample we can have up to 2 sessions (in case of multi-session)
     m_sessions = new vmc_vend_t.vend_session_t[1];

     // prepare single session object
     m_sessions[0] = new vmc_vend_t.vend_session_t(3, list);
   ```
9. The peripheral's SDK sends a "vend request" to the Nayax Device:
   ```c
   vmc_vend_vend_request(vend_session_t *session)
   ```
   ```csharp
   vmc_instance.vend.vend_request(session);
   ```
   ```java
   m_vmc.vend.vend_request(m_sessions[m_active_session]);
   ```
10. The peripheral's SDK handles transaction data received from the Nayax Device via Transfer Data (said data includes information about the Nayax transaction ID and the consumer's card details):
    ```c
    vmc_vend_event_handler_cb(vm_vend_event_on_transaction_info)
    ```
    ```csharp
    vend_callbacks(onTransactionInfo(data))
    ```
    ```java
    vmc_vend_events()
    (via onTransactionInfo(data))
    ```
11. The peripheral's SDK triggers the "vend approved" event:
    ```c
    vmc_vend_event_handler_cb(vm_vend_event_on_vend_approved)
    ```
    ```csharp
    vend_callbacks()
    (via onVendApproved(session))
    ```
    ```java
    vmc_vend_events()
    (via onVendApproved(session))
    ```
12. The peripheral dispenses the product/ provides the service to the consumer
13. The SDK reports "vend success":
    ```c
    vmc_vend_vend_status(&session, __true)
    ```
    ```csharp
    vmc_vend_events()
    (via onVendApproved(session) -which would return "true")
    ```
    ```java
    vmc_vend_events()
    (via onVendApproved(session) -which would return "true")
    ```
    * Note- in case of partial dispensing (meaning not all of the selected items were actually vended) you can create a new list with only the items which were actually vended prior to responding with "true":

      <Image align="center" border={false} caption="example of partial vending- in this example only 2 items were vended" src="https://files.readme.io/908de4aa3ae8ca7e7b4c8d9fd652b7993f561aee7084cdefa47f3093325ea448-6.jpg" width="500px" />
    And completes the vending session:
    ```c
    vmc_vend_vend_session_complete_lowlevel()
    ```
    ```csharp
    no such function in C# or Java due to the nature of the languages
    ```
    ```java
    no such function in C# or Java due to the nature of the languages
    ```
    <br />
14. Message to the consumer: "Please Take Product."
15. Nayax Device sends a settlement request to the Nayax Server.
16. Nayax Server forwards the settlement request to the Billing Provider.
17. The billing Provider sends a settlement response (OK) to the Nayax Server.
18. Nayax Server sends the settlement response (OK) back to the Nayax Device.
19. The vending session ends.
20. Message to Card Holder: "Thank you & Goodbye."
