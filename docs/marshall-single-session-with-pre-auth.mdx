title: "Single Session with Pre-Authorization"
---

This guide explains the **Pre-Authorization** vending flow. This process is key to minimizing risk because it approves payment before the customer selects a product.

## Payment Flow

Visualize the Pre-Authorization process with the diagram below, which illustrates each step of the single vending session flow, from product selection to payment authorization and dispensing.

Below is a breakdown of the diagram:

1. The consumer presents the card to the Nayax Device.
2. The Nayax Device sends an authorization request to the Nayax Server.
3. The Nayax Server forwards the authorization request to the Billing Provider.
4. The Billing Provider sends an authorization response (approved) to the Nayax Server.
5. Nayax Server sends the authorization response (approved) back to the Nayax Device.
6. The peripheral's SDK begins the session and triggers the "session begin" event:
   ```c
   vmc_vend_event_handler_cb(vm_vend_event_on_session_begin)
   ```
   ```csharp
   vend_callbacks(onBeginSession(funds_avail))
   ```
   ```java
   vmc_vend_events()
   (via onBeginSession(funds_avail))
   ```
7. Message to the consumer: "Please Select a Product."
8. The consumer selects a product.
9. The peripheral's SDK sends a "vend request" to the Nayax Device:
10. The peripheral's SDK handles transaction data received from the Nayax Device via Transfer Data command (said data includes information about the Nayax transaction ID and the consumer's card details):
    ```c
    vmc_vend_event_handler_cb(vm_vend_event_on_transaction_info)
    ```
    ```csharp
    vend_callbacks(onTransactionInfo(data))
    ```
    ```java
    vmc_vend_events()
    (via onTransactionInfo(data))
    ```
11. The peripheral's SDK triggers the "vend approved" event:
    ```c
    vmc_vend_event_handler_cb(vm_vend_event_on_vend_approved)
    ```
    ```csharp
    vend_callbacks()
    (via onVendApproved(session))
    ```
    ```java
    vmc_vend_events()
    (via onVendApproved(session))
    ```
12. The peripheral dispenses the product/ provides the service to the consumer
13. The SDK reports vend success:
    ```c
    vmc_vend_vend_status(&session, __true)
    ```
    ```csharp
    vmc_vend_events()
    (via onVendApproved(session) -which would return "true")
    ```
    ```java
    vmc_vend_events()
    (via onVendApproved(session) -which would return "true")
    ```
    And completes the vend session:
    ```c
    vmc_vend_vend_session_complete_lowlevel()
    ```
    ```csharp
    no such function in C# or Java due to the nature of the languages
    ```
    ```java
    no such function in C# or Java due to the nature of the languages
    ```
14. Message to the consumer: "Please Take Product."
15. Nayax Device sends a settlement request to the Nayax Server.
16. Nayax Server forwards the settlement request to the Billing Provider.
17. The billing Provider sends a settlement response (OK) to the Nayax Server.
18. Nayax Server sends the settlement response (OK) back to the Nayax Device.
19. The vending session ends.
20. Message to Card Holder: "Thank you & Goodbye."
