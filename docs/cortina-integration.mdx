title: "Integration Process"

Cortina's integration process follows several stages, ensuring the solution is implemented and tested before going live. The diagram below illustrates the integration process.

The steps in this process are as follows:

1. **Kickoff**: The Integrator and Nayax teams hold an initial meeting to align expectations, define high-level goals, and introduce the stakeholders from the Integrator's project, the technical teams, the Nayax Integration Engineer, and the Product Team.
2. **Scoping**: The Integrator completes a detailed onboarding form that clearly defines the integration requirements, use cases, limitations, and any necessary project dependencies.
3. **Test Environment Setup**: The Nayax Integration Engineer establishes the internal setup according to the scoping form. They configure any required networking, such as a VPN, the testing device, and the corresponding machine on Nayax Core.
4. **Development**: The Integrator begins implementing the Cortina API. The Nayax Integration Engineer provides consultation and resolves any technical queries or issues that may arise.
5. **Testing & Certification**: The Integrator validates their solution by performing internal testing. The Integrator then completes the mandatory Cortina Certification tests to ensure the solution is implemented correctly. The Integrator must also finalize all required additional certifications, such as EMV L3.
6. **Production Setup**: Once Certification is approved, the Nayax Integration Engineer configures the approved integration on the Nayax Production server and completes any final networking requirements in the live environment.\
   At this point the token used during the integration is replaced with a new one for production.
7. **Pilot**: The project launches a pilot with a limited number of active devices to verify real-world performance. This pilot runs for an agreed time or transaction volume, and the Integrator must resolve any issues discovered during this phase.
8. **Finalization**: Once both parties agree that all issues are resolved and the pilot results are satisfactory, the project transitions to ongoing support. Both sides share the contact details for their respective Production support, NOC, and operational teams.
