title: "getStatus"
---

The `getStatus` method returns the current AEA (Agamento Engine Application) service status and informs the client whether the payment engine is ready to process transactions (as opposed to getInternalStatus which provides information about the payment terminal's readiness to do the first part of processing a new transaction).\
It is intended to be called infrequently (e.g., a few times per day) to check the operational state of the engine.
