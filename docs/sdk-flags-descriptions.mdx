title: "SDK Flags"
---

The `vmc_configuration` object allows you to set various configuration flags. When using the Marshall SDK, these determine the behavior and capabilities of the peripheral (originally intended for vending machine controller -VMC).

## Configuration Flags

You can initiate these flags in the `main` method, as in the following code:

```java
public static void main(string[] args) {
    vmc_config.multi_vend_support = false;
    vmc_config.multi_session_support = false;
    vmc_config.price_not_final_support = false;
    vmc_config.reader_always_on = false;
    vmc_config.always_idle = false;
    vmc_config.vend_denied_policy = vmc_configuration.vend_denied_policy_cancel;

    vmc_config.mifare_approved_by_vmc_support = false;
    vmc_config.mag_card_approved_by_vmc_support = false;

    vmc_config.dump_packets_level = vmc_configuration.debug_level_dump_moderate;
    vmc_config.debug = true;
}
```
```csharp
public class vend_machine
    vmc_config.multi_session_support = false;
    vmc_config.multi_vend_support = false;
    vmc_config.price_not_final_support = false;
    vmc_config.reader_always_on = false;
    vmc_config.always_idle = false;
    vmc_config.vend_denied_policy = vmc_configuration.vend_denied_policy_cancel;

    vmc_config.mag_card_approved_by_vmc_support = false;
    vmc_config.mifare_approved_by_vmc_support = false;

    vmc_config.debug = true;
    vmc_config.dump_packets_level = vmc_configuration.debug_level_dump_moderate;

```
```c
vmc_config_t vmc_config;
  vmc_config.multi_session_support = __false;
  vmc_config.multi_vend_support = __false;
  vmc_config.price_not_final_support = __false;
  vmc_config.reader_always_on = __false;
  vmc_config.always_idle = __false;
  vmc_config.vend_denied_policy = vend_denied_policy_cancel_e;
  vmc_config.mag_card_approved_by_vmc_support = __false;
  vmc_config.mifare_approved_by_vmc_support = __false;
  vmc_config.qr_approved_by_vmc_support = __false;
  vmc_config.debug = __true;
  vmc_config.dump_packets_level = debug_level_dump_moderate;
```

### Flag Descriptions

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        Enabling the sale and differentiation of multiple products in a single transaction.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `multi_session_support`
      </td>

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        Enables the device to handle multiple sessions simultaneously, which is useful for scenarios where various transactions may be open at the same time.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `price_not_final_support`
      </td>

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        Relevant for multi-session (pre-selection) flow only. Indicates that the authorization price received from the server is not final, meaning using it alongside Multi-session would have it behave similarly to a pre-authorization process, ensuring the balance isn't captured for a few days.
        You can read more on that in the [Multi-Session](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/marshall-multi-session#/)  for more details.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `reader_always_on`
      </td>

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        It keeps the device's reader always turned on and ready to start transactions from the device's end instead of the peripheral. When used, a trigger for the product selection would be a card presentation or touching a button on the device instead of selecting a product on the peripheral's end.

      <td>
        `always_idle`
      </td>

      <td>
        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        The transaction starts with the consumer selecting a product on the peripheral. The peripheral can send the "Vend request" command without waiting for a "Begin Session" trigger.

        boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        Allows Mifare (prepaid) cards authorized by a third-party server. The card's data is being forwarded to the peripheral and it is up for it to approve/decline the card.
