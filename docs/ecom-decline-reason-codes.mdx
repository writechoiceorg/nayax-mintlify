title: "Decline Reason Codes"
---

Transaction refusal codes constitute a standardized classification system designed to communicate the precise reason for payment authorization failures within the electronic payment processing infrastructure. This reference documentation establishes a comprehensive framework for interpreting declined transactions across multiple failure scenarios.

## Decline Codes

The table below describes each Decline Code in more detail.
