## Get Cards

This general endpoint will retrieve an overview of all cards, including essential details like Card ID, Card Holder Name, and Card Status. See the example query:

     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

Any of the following details of a card can be used as a query parameter:

* `CardID`

* `ExternalApplicationUserID`
* `CardEmail`
