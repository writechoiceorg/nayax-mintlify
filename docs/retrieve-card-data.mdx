## Get Cards

This general endpoint will retrieve an overview of all cards, including essential details like Card ID, Card Holder Name, and Card Status. See the example query:

```curl Request
curl --request GET \
     --url https://qa-lynx.nayax.com/operational/v1/cards \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

This endpoint can also retrieve details of a specific card instead of all cards by adding query parameters to the request. For example, to get the details of a card with the Card Unique Identifier "1409315030\` you can use the query in the code block below.

```curl Request
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://qa-lynx.nayax.com/operational/v1/cards?CardUniqueIdentifier=1409315030%20' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

Any of the following details of a card can be used as a query parameter:

* `CardID`
* `CardUniqueIdentifier`
* `CardDisplayNumber`
* `CardMobileNumber`
* `ExternalApplicationUserID`
* `CardEmail`
* `CardHolderName`

## Get Card by the Card's Display Number

It fetches card details based on its display number, which is the physical card number. This is ideal for cases where only the display number is available for reference.

See the code block below for an example query:

```curl

     --url https://qa-lynx.nayax.com/operational/v1/cards/displayNumber/{CardDisplayNumber} \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

<Note>
  Replace `{CardDisplayNumber}` with the actual number of the card.
</Note>

## Get Prepaid Card

It retrieves details of a prepaid card associated with a specific card ID. Use this to manage prepaid cards or verify their status and attributes.

See the code block below for an example query:

```curl Request
curl --request GET \
     --url https://qa-lynx.nayax.com/operational/v1/cards/CardID/prepaid \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'

```

     --header 'accept: application/json'
```
