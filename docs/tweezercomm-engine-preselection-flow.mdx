The Pre-Selection transaction flow processes, authorizes, and settles a payment request before completing the transaction. This streamlined approach ensures that all payment stages are finalized in a single, continuous sequence.

## Transaction Flow

To understand the Pre-selection transaction flow, consider the following sequence of events:

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. After the cardholder selects the product or service, the Machine sends a [`doTransaction()`](doc:dotransaction) Request to the Agamento Application.
2. The application then displays a prompt for the cardholder, requesting him to insert or swipe a card.
3. The cardholder inserts, swipes, or taps their card on the Host Machine.
4. The Agamento Device communicates with the Nayax Server to request payment authorization and settlement.
5. The Nayax Server responds with the transaction status (approved or declined). The Agamento Application then relays this status back to the Host Machine, completing the process.
