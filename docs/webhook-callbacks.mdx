title: "Webhook Callbacks"
---

Webhooks are a crucial part of the Spark API, as they serve as automatic callbacks that alert your system to important events without requiring constant monitoring. For example, the `DeclineCallback `is triggered if a transaction fails after a successful `TriggerTransaction `request. This could happen if a consumer cancels the transaction on the device or if the terminal times out. Other webhooks, like `TimeoutCallback `and `StopCallback`, let you know when a session has timed out or when a card has been presented to stop a session, respectively.

By using these callbacks, you can quickly handle failures and other events, ensuring your system's transaction state remains accurate without requiring constant polling.

### Enable Custom Headers (Optional)

This feature allows Nayax to send up to two static custom headers (e.g., for a shared secret or routing ID) with every callback to your system for enhanced security and verification.

To enable custom headers for your integration:

1. **Request enablement** – Contact your Nayax Integration Support Engineer and ask to enable custom headers for your integration in the Nayax Backoffice.
2. **Provide header details** – Share the following information with your Integration Support Engineer:
   * Header Key – Up to 2 keys (minimum 1).
   * Header Value – Up to 2 values (minimum 1).
