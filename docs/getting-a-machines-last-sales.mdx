import {EndpointCard} from "/snippets/EndpointCard.jsx";

In some cases, you may want to see the last sales of a machine to retrieve information about specific transactions. Nayax Core allows you to do so in the following way:

1. Go to **Operations > Machines** .
2. Choose your machine and click **Info > Last Sales** .

<Frame><img src="/images/docs/getting-a-machines-last-sales/image1.png" /></Frame>

You will be presented with a list containing the latest machine transactions.

## Lynx API

Lynx API allows you to do this process programmatically through a GET request. This page will guide you on how to do so using the endpoint below.

<EndpointCard
  title="Get Last Sales for Machine by MachineID"
  href="/reference/lynx/machines/get-last-sales-for-machine-by-machineid"
  method="get"
/>

### Retrieving the Last Sales

You'll use the [Get Last Sales for Machine](/reference/lynx/machines/get-last-sales-for-machine-by-machineid) endpoint, adding the machine's unique identifier as a path parameter to retrieve details about the respective machine. This lets you view the latest sales activity associated with the searched machine. See the example request in the code block below:

```sh Request
curl -X GET "https://lynx.nayax.com/operational/api/v1/machines/<MachineID>/lastSales" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Note>
**Path Params**

Replace `<MachineID>` with the actual machine unique identifier you want to search.
</Note>

With a successful request, the endpoint will return with a list of recent sales related to the machine. This response JSON will have the following format:
