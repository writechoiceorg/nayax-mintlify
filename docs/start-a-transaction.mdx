title: "Initialize Transactions"
---

The `/initialize` endpoint is the first step in processing an e-commerce transaction within the Nayax system. Its primary function is to initiate a payment request from the Nayax SDK, essentially setting the stage for a customer to complete their purchase.

<Note>
**Tokenization**

The `/initialize` endpoint is also part of the process for tokenizing a card. If a Card-on-File (COF) initialization is triggered, the eCom API will respond with a Nayax card token to the Nayax SDK. See [Nayax Tokens](doc:nayax-ecom-tokens) for more details.

## Sale Request

Here is an example of a JSON request for the POST [ `/initialize` ](ref:post_initialize) endpoint, demonstrating a simple sale transaction.

```json
{
  "BasicInfo": {
    "SessionExpiration": "2025-08-15T10:00:00Z",
    "RedirectURL": "https://www.examplemerchant.com/return",
    "Amount": 1500,

```

## Transaction Type

The [`/initialize` ](<ref: post_initialize>) endpoint supports various transaction types such as a sale, refund, void, and pre-authorizations. The `RequestType` parameter, a mandatory number field, specifies the type of transaction to be performed for a session. It serves as a flag to inform the system of the desired action.

The table below displays the codes available for the `RequestType` parameter and the associated transaction type.

| Code | Transaction Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Sale                 | A simple, immediate transaction where funds are authorized and captured at the same time. Used for a single, complete purchase.                             |
| `1`  | Auth (Authorization) | A transaction type for pre-authorization that reserves a specific amount of funds on a card without immediately charging it.                                |
| `2`  | Settlement           | Used to capture funds that have been previously authorized, finalizing the transaction, and moving the money from the customer's account to the merchant's. |
| `3`  | Void                 | Used to cancel a transaction before it has been settled.                                                                                                    |
| `4`  | Refund               | For returning funds to a customer's account after a sale has been completed.                                                                                |
| `5`  | Partial refund       | This is similar to a refund, but only a portion of the original transaction amount is returned to the customer.                                             |
| `6`  | Incremental auth     | Used to increase the amount of a pre-authorized transaction.                                                                                                |
| `7`  | Cancel Auth          | This action cancels a pre-authorized transaction, releasing the held funds on the customer's card.                                                          |
| `8`  | Partial capture      | Allows a merchant to capture a portion of the pre-authorized amount, rather than the full amount.                                                           |
