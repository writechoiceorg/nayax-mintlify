To monitor operational performance and financial metrics, such as sales trends and machine health, go to **Reports > Dashboard** in **[Nayax Core](https://qa.nayax.com/core/public/f?model=reports/dashboard)**. This page provides a customizable view of your business through various dashboards and data widgets.

Widgets and dashboards serve two main levels within the Nayax Core platform:

* **Actor (Operator) Level**: It consolidates data from all machines operated by a specific Actor or Operator.
* **Machine Level**: It shows data relevant only to a single machine.

  You can also use the Lynx API to retrieve the raw data from these widgets in a structured format (JSON). See [Get Machine Widget Data Using the API](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/retrieve-machine-widget-data) to learn more.
