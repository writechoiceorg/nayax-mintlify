Product groups in Nayax are organizational entities that categorize products into clusters. By grouping similar products, operators can streamline processes like inventory tracking, reporting, and restocking, ensuring better management and oversight of their product offerings.

In Nayax Core, you can create a product group in the following way:

1. Go to **Administration> Products**.
2. Click **Create > Add Product Group**
3. Fill in the required Product Group details in the form
   1. Operator: Select which operator is associated with the group.
   2. Description: the name of the product group.
4. Click **Save** to finish.

## Lynx API

You can also perform this programmatically through Lynx API by performing a POST Request on the following endpoint:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title={
      <div class="card_content">
        <h3><span class="post">post</span> Create Product Groups</h3>
      </div>
    }
    href="/reference/create-product-groups"
  />
</CardGroup>
