import {EndpointCard} from "/snippets/EndpointCard.jsx";

The refund process begins by submitting a request with details such as the refund amount and reason. This notifies the customer that the refund is being processed. We will describe this process in more detail on this page.

**Credit Cards Only**

Refunds can only be requested for transaction done through Credit Card. This option is not available for prepaid cards.

1. Access **Reports > Online Reports > Dynamic Transactions Monitor**.
2. Search for the transaction to refund. You can use the filter feature to make this easier.
3. Right-click the transaction you want to refund.
4. Click **Request Refund**

### Initiating the request

#### How to obtain TransactionID and SiteID

The `TransactionId `and `SiteId ` can be retrieved in the Lynx API using the [ Get Last Sales for Machine ](/reference/get-last-sales-for-machine) endpoint to retrieve the last sales using the `MachineID` and the response object should have the necessary data.

## Request Status

Once you send the request, a notification email will be sent to the email address entered in the request parameters.

The refund is now in the `pending `status and will need to be approved or declined. See [Approve or Decline a Refund](/docs/approve-or-decline-a-refund) for more details.
