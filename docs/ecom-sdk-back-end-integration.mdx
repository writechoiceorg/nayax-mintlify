Nayax provides the eCom API to process the intricate server-side logic, data storage, and authentication necessary to ensure that transactions are processed efficiently and securely.

<Note>
**API Reference**

See the complete [API Reference](ref:ecom-api-overview) of the eCom API for more details on its endpoints and parameters.

## eCom API

This API serves as the interface for handling eCom requests, including initialization and payment. See the diagram below:

As you can see, the eCom API receives calls from the SDK, processes them, and returns a response.

1. When a recurring payment is performed, the eCom SDK sends[ `/charge-token` ](ref:post_charge-token)a request to the Nayax Server via the eCom API.
2. The Nayax Server creates a payment session.
3. Nayax Server sends a webhook notification to your back-end with the final transaction status.
