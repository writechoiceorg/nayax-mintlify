## eCom API

This API serves as the interface for handling eCom requests, including initialization and payment. See the diagram below:

Where:

1. The merchant's backend sends an API request to the Nayax Server.
2. Nayax processes the request and sends a response (approved or declined) to the Merchant's back end.
3. Asynchronously, the Nayax Server sends a webhook notification to your back-end with the final transaction status.
