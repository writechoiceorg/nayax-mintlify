title: "Single Step Payment"
---

The single-step payment flow allows for immediate authorization and settlement in one operation, streamlining the payment process for use cases that require fast, straightforward transactions. While less robust than the two-step process (`PreAuthorize `and `ConfirmTransaction`), it is suitable for low-risk environments such as vending machines or self-service kiosks.

<Warning>
**Pre-Authorization**

Nayax encourages merchants to choose the [Payment with Pre-Authorization](doc:payment-with-authorization) approach since it's safer in cases of communication problem.

## Transaction Flow

The Diagram below exemplifies the transaction flow for a Single Step payment:

Where:

1. The host application initiates a payment transaction by calling the [`PayTransaction`](doc:payment-1#paytransaction) method. The total transaction amount, currency, and other parameters are specified upfront to EMV Core.
2. EMV Core polls the card reader to see if there is a card.
3. The user taps or inserts their card.
4. EMV Core captures the card's encrypted data.
5. The encrypted card data is sent to the EMV Core.
6. EmV COre confirms the transaction and sends the details to the Nayax Server.
7. The server receives the transaction data and performs the settlement, confirming it to EMV Core.
8. EMV Core receives the transaction result from the server and triggers the [`TransactionComplete`](doc:event-callbacks#transactioncomplete) event, sending the transaction's data.
9. The vending is finalized, and the product is delivered to the user.
10. The transaction report is sent to the Kiosk Application server.
