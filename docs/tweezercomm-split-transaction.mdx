title: "Split Transaction"

The Split Transaction flow is used for transactions involving multiple sub-merchants. The diagram illustrates how a Milgam System can initiate a transaction on the Nayax Device and receive a response that includes a specific attribute for a sub-retailer.

## Transaction Flow

To understand the Split transaction flow, consider the following sequence of events:

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. The Milgam System sends one or more [`addSubRetailer()`](/docs/addsubretailer) requests to the Nayax Device. In the example, three such requests are made.
2. The Milgam System performs its [`doPeriodic()`](/docs/doperiodic) call and then initiates a transaction with a [`doTransaction()`](/docs/dotransaction-ashrait) request.
3. The CardHolder presents their card.
4. The Nayax Device communicates with the payment server to perform the Authorization and Settlement of the transaction.
5. The payment server sends the transaction result back to the Nayax Device.
6. The Nayax Device relays the transaction result to the Milgam System, including a `subRetailer` attribute with the value `XXXXX` to identify the relevant sub-retailer.
