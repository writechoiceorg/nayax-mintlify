title: "Apple Pay Integration Setup"
---

To enable Apple Pay as a payment method with the Nayax eCom SDK, you must verify your merchant domain. Follow these steps to complete the integration:

1. Contact your Nayax Solution Architect with the URL from where Apple Pay transactions will originate (your merchant domain).

2. Host a domain association file to prove ownership of your domain.
   * **Download the certificate file here:**
     [https://nayax-ecom-apple-pay.nayax.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association](https://nayax-ecom-apple-pay.nayax.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association)

   * **Host the file at the exact following path on your server:**
     [https://your-domain.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association](your-domain.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association)

3. Ensure the URL hosting the certificate is accessible from the public internet. At a minimum, it must be open to Apple's validation servers. See [Apple Pay IP Addresses](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applepayontheweb/setting-up-your-server#Allow-Apple-Pay-IP-Addresses) to learn more.

4. After completing steps 1-3, email your Nayax Solution Architect. They will finalize the configuration on the Nayax side.
