title: "Settlement"
---

This request is used to finalize or capture funds from a previously authorized transaction. It uses the same endpoint as the initial charge/authorization, but the request body includes the details of the transaction being settled.

<Note>
**Partial Settlement**

This request can also perform partial settlements.
</Note>

## Request

The Settlement request uses the same endpoint as the initial [ `/charge-token` ](https://developerhub.nayax.com/reference/post_charge-token) request. The API determines it's a settlement based on the `RequestType `value within the `BasicInfo `object.

Note the key differences from a [ `/charge-token` ](https://developerhub.nayax.com/reference/post_charge-token) request:

* The `RequestType `will be set to the value for Settlement/Capture, which is `2`.
* The request includes the original Transaction ID (`transactionId`) and the original Merchant Request ID (`merchantRequestId`) from the authorization phase.

See the example below:

```json
{
  "basicInfo": {
    "requestType": 2,          // Example: 2 for Settlement/Capture
    "entryMode": 1,
    "amount": 25.00,           // The amount to capture (must be <= authorized amount)
    "currency": "EUR",
    "countryCode": "DE",
    "tokenModel": 1,
    "cvc": null,
    "token": null,
    "merchantRequestId": "ORIGINAL_MERCH_REQ_001", // ID from the original Auth
    "transactionId": "ORIGINAL_NAYAX_TRX_98765", // ID from the original Auth response
    "transactionTimeUtc": "2025-08-28T10:30:00Z", // Time from the original Auth response
    "isSaveTokenWithoutConsent": false
  },
  "machineInfo": {
    "machineId": "0434334921100366"
  },
  "cardHolderInfo": {},  // Empty or minimal data needed
  "paymentInfo": {},     // Empty or minimal data needed
  "additionalInfo": {},
  "validationKey": "AUTH_VALID_KEY_XYZ"
}
```
