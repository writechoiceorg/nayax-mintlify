Logging is essential for debugging and monitoring the SDK's behavior and interactions with the peripheral. It is Nayax's main tool for understanding what's happening on the peripheral's end, as well as in the connection between the device and peripheral.

## Configuration

To have logs of the SDK, you need to configure the following flags in the `main` method:

* `dump_packets_level` (_`vmc_configuration`_):  Determines the level of detail required to log messages generated by the SDK. These are the options available:
  * `debug_level_dump_none`: Don't generate a log.
  * `debug_level_dump_all`: Log all messages.
  * `debug_level_dump_moderate`: Logs all messages, excluding keep-alives and their ACKs.
* `debug ` ( _boolean_): Enables or disables log generation.

You can add these flags to the main method, as in the example below.

```java
public static void main(string[] args) {
    vmc_config.dump_packets_level = vmc_configuration.debug_level_dump_moderate;
    vmc_config.debug = true;
}
```
```csharp
public class vend_machine
    vmc_config.debug = true;
    vmc_config.dump_packets_level = vmc_configuration.debug_level_dump_moderate;

```
```c
vmc_init()
	config.dump_packets_level = debug_level_dump_none;
```

## Log file location

The logs generated by the SDK are written to a specific file location.

* On the **C# SDK**, the logs are automatically saved inside the same directory you run the SDK from, inside the `bin\Debug` folder.
  For example:

  <Image align="center" border={false} src="https://files.readme.io/4ac848f8c2daa3b50b223ef9571f5f896e5a972ff1b947e04f2de35576c88b35-Screenshot_4.jpg" />
* On the **C SDK**, the log location is determined by invoking the function below.
  ```c
  void printk_register_puts(printk_puts_pfunc cb);
  ```
* On the **Java SDK**, the default log file path is specified in the `FileWriter `initialization. See the following example.

  ```java
  if (vmc_config.debug) {
    BufferedWriter out = null;
    try {
        FileWriter fstream = new FileWriter("c:\\out.txt", true); // true to append data
        out = new BufferedWriter(fstream);
        Log.initialize(out);
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Handle exception
    }
  }
  ```

In the code above, the log file is created at the root of the **C:** drive with the name `out.txt`. The `true `parameter in the `FileWriter `constructor indicates that data will be appended to the existing log file if it already exists.
