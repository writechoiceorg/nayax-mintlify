TweezerComm follows structured payment flows to ensure secure and efficient transaction processing. These define how different transaction types are handled within the system, including transactions for loyalty cards. Understanding these flows enables client applications to integrate appropriately with the AshraitEMV Application (AEA)  and optimize payment processing capabilities.
