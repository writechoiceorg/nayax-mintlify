title: "Partial Approval in Cortina Prepaid Authorization"
---

This feature allows a prepaid processor to approve a lower authorization amount if the cardholder does not have enough balance to cover the full requested amount, increasing the integration's approval rate.

The partially approved amount can be used for purchase and will limit the settlement amount.

## How to Implement

In the [Authorization endpoint response]() set the attribute as following:

* `Status.Verdict` = Approved
* `Status .Code` = 0
* `PaymentInfo. AuthAmount` = Approve amount for pre-authorization.

See the example below:

```json
{"Status": {
  "Verdict": "Approved",
  "Code": 0,},
  "PaymentInfo": {
  "AuthAmount": 5}
  }
```
