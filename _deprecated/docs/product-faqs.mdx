This FAQ page addresses common questions and issues related to managing the product map and updates in the Lynx API.

## Why did updating only one product nullify the rest of my products?

When you send an update request for a single product, it rewrites the entire product map. This means that if you don't include all the products and their current values in the request, the omitted products will be set to "null" or default values. To avoid this, you should always send the full list of products and make changes only to the specific product you want to update.

## Has the option to post product images been added?

No, the option to post product images has not been added yet. However, it is still on the development roadmap and may be included in a future release.

## Will there be options for working with product map templates (creation, duplication, updates to machines)?

Yes, options for working with product map templates are on the roadmap. However, these features will not be available in the near future.

## How can we reset/delete a machine’s product map through Lynx?

The `MachineProductID` serves as the identifier for each line in the product map, allowing you to make changes to individual lines using it as a reference. However, you cannot "delete" or "reset" the entire product map technically. You can manually change the values for each line to your desired values, but the lines will still exist in the map.
