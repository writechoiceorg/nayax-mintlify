The Deferred transaction flow processes a payment request in two distinct phases:

1. A Pre-Authorization phase
2. A final Authorization and Settlement phase

This two-step approach is particularly useful for transactions where the final amount or details may change after the initial card interaction.

## Transaction Flow

To understand the Deferred transaction flow, consider the following sequence of events:

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. After the client application (POS) performs its [`doPeriodic()` ](doc:doperiodic) and `setConfig()` calls, it sends a [`doTransaction()`](doc:dotransaction-ashrait) request to the Nayax Device.
2. The CardHolder inserts their physical card.
3. The Nayax Device processes the transaction, and the result is returned as `Approved-> Done` which indicates that the transaction is complete.
4. Later, the client application sends another[ `doTransaction()`](doc:dotransaction-ashrait) request to the Nayax Device.
5. The CardHolder taps their contactless card.
6. The Nayax Device checks for "Deferred pre-conditions" and, upon approval, returns the transaction result as `Approved->Pending` This means the transaction is approved but waiting for final authorization.
7. The client application calls `setConfig()` and then `authorizePendingTransactions()`.
8. The Nayax Device communicates with the payment server to finalize the authorization of the pending transaction.
9. The transaction results are returned to the client application.
10. The flow concludes with a final [`doPeriodic()`](doc:doperiodic) call from the client application.
