The discount feature allows Payment Gateways, implementing Cortina External PP API, to adjust the final settlement amount of a transaction to represent a Discount given to the cardholder by the External PP Provider.

## How to Implement

To do so, the final amount (after the discount amount was deducted) should be sent in `SettAmount` fields, under the  `PaymentInfo `object of the [Settlement endpoint response]() or at the [Sale endpoint response.]()

The amount sent must be equal to or lower than the original amount and could never be higher than the original Authorization amount.

The discounted amount will be reflected in the transaction settlement amount of the transaction record, which can be viewed in the transaction reports available in Nayax Core. Please note that this field is used for reporting purposes only and can only be used for cases where the Payment Gateway is covering the discount costs.

See the example below:

```json
{
"PaymentInfo": {
      "SettAmount": 0.1}}
```
