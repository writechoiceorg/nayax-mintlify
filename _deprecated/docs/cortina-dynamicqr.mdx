DynamicQR codes enable customers to complete payments by scanning the code with their mobile device, but with an added layer of security generating a unique code for each transaction, ensuring the QR code cannot be reused, making it ideal for high-value or secure transactions.

## How it works

The image below describes the typical usage flow of DynamicQR.

<Frame>![](/images/docs/cortina-dynamicqr/images1.png)</Frame>

Where:

1. The customer starts by selecting a product.
2. The customer chooses the QR payment option.
3. The device presents the generated QR code.
4. The customer scans this code to initiate the payment.
5. The payment is processed and approved.

<Warning>
**Pre-Selection Only**

Cortina Dynamic QR currently only supports Pre-Selection transaction types.

## Pre-selection Flow

The Pre-selection flow simplifies the payment process by merging the steps of product/service selection and authorization into a single transaction. This flow is typically used for low-value or quick transactions, where the customer’s selection and payment authorization are handled together in one step.

See the diagram below:

Where:

1. The process begins with selecting a product or service on the machine. This action triggers the Machine to send a QR command request to the Nayax Server, informing it of the incoming transaction.
2. The Server sends the request to the integrator using the [DynamicQR GenerateQR](ref:post_cortina-dynamicqr-generateqr) endpoint.
3. The Device approves the request and sends a Payment Request to the Nayax Server, which begins the payment authorization process.
4. The Server sends the request to the integrator using the [DynamicQR Inquiry](ref:post_cortina-dynamicqr-inquiry) endpoint.
5. The Nayax Server receives the Response from the Integrator and returns it to the Device.
6. If authorized, the Device begins the Vending Session, and the machine dispenses the product or service. The device sends the settlement command to the Nayax Server.
7. The Nayax server forwards the Settlement Request to the integrator using Cortina's API [Sale End Notification](ref:post_cortina-saleendnotification) endpoint, with the final transaction amount to be settled.

This response is typically always approved in this flow, as the authorization has already been granted.
