title: "info"
description: "Exchange system metadata and retrieve terminal configuration settings."
---

The `info` method exchanges version information and device metadata between the client application (POS/FCC) and the VPOS terminal. This typically serves as the first command sent after establishing a TCP connection to ensure compatibility between both systems.

Use this method to:
* Exchange vendor, model, and serial number details for system identification.
* Synchronize software and hardware versions to ensure protocol feature alignment.
* Retrieve critical terminal settings, such as the defined decimal place for transaction amounts.

## Requests

All requests must include the `command` and a unique `requestId`. The `data` object should contain the details of the client system making the request.

The following example shows a typical request:

```json
{
"command": "info",
"requestId": "req-020",
"data": {
"vendor": "Nayax Fuel",
"model": "FCC-3000",
"serialNumber": "FCC-12345678",
"swVersion": "1.2.3.4",
"hwVersion": "4.3.2.1"
}
}
```

### Parameter Definitions

The table below describes the parameters provided by your system in this request[cite: 100]:

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **vendor** | string | Yes | The vendor name of the client system (e.g., "Nayax Fuel"). |
| **model** | string | Yes | The model identifier of the POS or FCC hardware. |
| **serialNumber** | string | Yes | The unique serial number of the client system. |
| **swVersion** | string | Yes | The current software version of the client application. |
| **hwVersion** | string | Yes | The hardware version of the client device. |

## Responses

The VPOS terminal returns its own hardware and software specifications, along with regional settings required for payment processing.
The following example shows a typical response:

```json
{
"requestId": "req-020",
"data": {
"serialNumber": "P129901X251AD",
"osVersion": "16.0",
"appVersion": "2.3.4.5",
"paymentVersion": "0.0.2.68",
"decimalPlace": 2
}
}
```

### Response Parameters
Below are the parameters returned by the VPOS terminal:

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **serialNumber** | string | The unique serial number of the VPOS terminal. |
| **osVersion** | string | The operating system version running on the device. |
| **appVersion** | string | The version of the primary terminal application. |
| **paymentVersion** | string | The specific version of the payment processing module. |
| **decimalPlace** | integer | The number of decimal places to be used for all transaction amounts (e.g., `2` means an amount of `5000` represents `$50.00`). |
