Touch devices include all Nayax devices with touch screens, such as the Nayax VPOS Touch, Onyx, and Fusion. These devices are designed for advanced functions like payments, monitoring, and network management.
Media devices include the newer generation of touch screens- VPOS Media 4, VPOS Media 4 Mini (also known as VPOS Media 4S) and VPOS Media 5. It is also planned on the roadmap to have VPOS Media 10.
Below are the steps for correctly installing these devices.

## System Requirements

Before installation, the NayaxVend Management System must be updated via the backend.
Please note that upon purchase, the device is preconfigured by Nayax support with standard machine parameters. For specific machines, ensure the relevant parameters are updated in the system to match their requirements.

For additional support or further information, contact your local Nayax support team.

<Note>
**Note**

For an integration, a SDK sample app is required to test real purchase scenarios.

## Installation- VPOS Touch

### Insert SIM

By default, the SIM cad would already be installed. If not- ensure the SIM card is ready to be inserted and installed prior to starting the integration. 

1. Locate the SIM socket at the top of the device.
2. Insert the SIM card into the socket securely, ensuring it is properly fitted.

### Connect Marshall Cable

Ensure all necessary components are ready before connecting the Marshall cable

1. Insert the Touch device cable connector into the Nayax device.

2. Connect the COM 2 / Marshall connector to the PC.
3. Attach the power adaptor connector to the Marshall cable.

### Set Up the Network

Now, it’s time to set up the network for your Touch device. To ensure everything runs smoothly, you must connect the cellular antenna and the LAN (Ethernet) cable.

#### Connect the Antenna (Cellular)

To enable cellular network connectivity, follow these steps:

1. Locate the SMA connector on the device.
2. Connect the antenna's **SMA female connector** to the **SMA male connector** on the Touch device.

#### Connect the LAN Cable (Ethernet)

To set up the wired network connection, insert the Ethernet cable into the device's LAN port. Ensure the other end of the cable is connected to a router or network switch.

<Note>
**Ethernet Connection Priority**

When both Ethernet and SIM connections are active, the system automatically prioritizes the Ethernet connection. This ensures greater stability and faster network performance.

## Installation- VPOS Media

### Connect Marshall Cable

1. Insert the Media device cable connector into the Nayax device.

2. i. Marshall over RS232:
   Connect the COM 2 (Marshall) connector to the PC either directly or via Chipi-x.
   Note that Chipi-x is the only USB to COM adaptor approved by Nayax's technical team!

   <br />

   ii. Marshall over ETH:
   It is planned on the roadmap to have Marshall over ETH (LAN and WIFI).
   In that case, you can either connect your LAN connector to the device:

   <Image align="center" border={false} width="300px" src="https://files.readme.io/a28a07168461225e06f6e52bfa8c01d683989bb2c3adb8a1cb1c154460905b0a-VPOSM_LAN_connector.jpg" />

   Or to your WIFI network.

   * Note- the VPOS Media should be connected to the same local network as the peripheral!
3. Connect the antenna (optional if using ETH)
   As the manual which comes with the VPOS Media explains, put in the antenna:
