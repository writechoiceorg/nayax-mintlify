Amazon SQS (Simple Queuing Service) is a Queue mechanism that allows a robust, redundant, and reliable way to transfer data between systems without the hassle of managing retry mechanisms. Nayax has created a mechanism to deliver key information such as Transactions, EVA DTS Audit files, and Events to Amazon SQS Queues. 

By integrating SQS with Nayax Core, operators can securely transmit payment details, machine events, and audit data while maintaining data integrity and encryption. The guide outlines steps to configure SQS queues, manage access via IAM policies, and implement encryption for message security. It also provides detailed examples of JSON message formats, ensuring compatibility with Nayax’s systems. 

The integration is a two-step process, consisting of:

1. [Setting up Amazon Queue in AWS](doc:amazon-queue-setup)
2. [Configuring Nayax Core](doc:nayax-back-office-setup)

Check the guides for each step for more details on applying them in your setup.
