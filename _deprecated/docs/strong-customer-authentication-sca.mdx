title: "Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)"
---

Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a regulatory requirement under the EU’s PSD2 directive, designed to reduce fraud and enhance security during electronic payments.

In a card-present transaction, SCA is typically performed through the Cardholder Verification Method (CVM), such as PIN entry, biometric verification (via mobile wallet), or signature, when the transaction amount exceeds the CVM limit.

## Soft Decline

In some cases, a transaction under the CVM limit will be declined with a Soft Decline.  

This occurs when a transaction is technically authorized by the issuer (i.e., the card is valid and has sufficient funds). Still, the issuer requests that Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) be performed before authorizing the payment. This is common in cases where the issuer suspects risk (e.g., a contactless tap without CVM after many prior low-value taps) or the transaction exceeds regulatory limits.

### Decline with PIN Required

In these cases, the acquirer receives a decline code indicating that an Online PIN is required for transaction approval. In that case, the Terminal will keep the transaction session and ask the cardholder to enter their PIN on the PIN pad. The Encrypted PIN will then be sent back to the acquirer for validation before the transaction can be settled.

To implement it, return a `Verdict=Declined` with `Code 983` to the Authorization\\Sale request.

If a transaction were completed with an online PIN, the Nayax engine would return an echoed Authorization\\Sale request with a PIN Block under the `DukptInfo `object.

```json
"Status": {
  "Verdict": "Declined",
  "Code": 983,
  "StatusMessage": "SCA- Soft Declined"
}
```

### Decline with Switch Interface

In these cases, the acquirer receives a decline code indicating that the transaction must be initiated again, using the Contact Interface. In that  case, the Terminal will prompt the user to insert his card and perform a transaction with PIN (offline or online).

To implement it, return a `Verdict=Declined` with `Code 1021` to the Authorization\\Sale request.

If a transaction was completed with the contact interface, the Nayax engine will send a new Authorization\\Sale request. If an online PIN was performed, the PIN Block will be sent under the `DukptInfo `object.

```json
"Status": {
  "Verdict": "Declined",
  "Code": 1021,
  "StatusMessage": "SCA- Switch Interface"
}
```
