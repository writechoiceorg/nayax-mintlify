In Nayax, Operators represent the entities or organizations responsible for managing machines, products, and associated systems. Operators act as the primary administrators within the system, overseeing the setup, monitoring, and maintenance of their inventory, transactions, and user roles. Each operator is uniquely identified and can manage multiple machines, product groups, and users.

For example, if a vending company operates machines across multiple cities. Each city can be managed as an operator, with assigned machines, devices, and product configurations. This structure allows for:

* Monitoring machine inventory levels.
* Managing localized product offerings.
* Generating region-specific transaction reports.

This section contains guides to help you manage operators using the Lynx API. Below is a list of the available guides:
