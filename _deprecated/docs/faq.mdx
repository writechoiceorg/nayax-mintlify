## Device being stuck on "Nayax" screen during powerup- communication issue:

This could happen due to multiple reasons:

1. Modem connection issues/bad cellular reception/ connected to ETH and the connection is poor. Do you happen to use ETH? Or have the devices near something that would block cellular reception?
2. Wrong modem type (for example European modem in the US) or a modem that is not too strong. Which modem type are you using?
3. SIM card not installed/supported (for example a SIM card that you bought outside of Nayax)/all used up. Which SIM are you using?
4. Antenna is not connected properly/ wrapped up around itself/pointing downwards/ around a metal box. Can you have a look at it?
5. If the device gets to the Nayax logo, then crashes- Do you have 24V power source with minimum 1.5A?

Device is connected to the Marshall cable but the device is in Cash Only

Which COM have you connected to your board? Is it COM2 as mentioned in the "Installation Guide"?
If you're using a Chipi-X (specific USB to COM adaptor. The only one which grants support privileges!)- does the Chipi-X seems to be connected to a hub- try connecting it directly to the PC.

## Everything is connected as expected but things still doesn't work- what now?

1. Check the parameters in Nayax Core
2. Check that the physical connection fits the instructions as in the [Installation Steps](https://developerhub.nayax.com/docs/installation-steps#/)
3. If OK – please reboot the device:

* disconnect from power,
* wait for the screen to go black
* power the device back

4. Check that in the code of the SDK you changed the COM port to the relevant one
5. Compile and Run the SDK:
   a.	Do you see the peripheral simulator's menu and pairing process displayed in the prompt window?
   b.	Do you see in the log file that the Pairing process ended successfully?

## Changing Idle screen/customization of screens/ UI control

At the moment, only the following modifications are available:

* At IDLE state, you can select the pictures/animations to be displayed over our DCS back office.
  You can also add some customized image e.g. displaying the logo of your company.

* Or change the title at idle mode:

* At end of transaction, you can remove the "Thank you and good bye" message: both picture and voice message will not be displayed/played.

For VPOS Touch- During the transaction process, there is not much to do in terms of UI and both messages and images/animations cannot be customized.
Regarding VPOS Media- this is a new product that is at the final stages of development, there is a possibility of editing the screens and animations- but this section would be updated once it would be released.
