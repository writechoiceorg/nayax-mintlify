**What is the certification process?**
The Marshall certification process is made up of a list of tests that you, the customer, would need to do once he completes the SDK's implementation. These tests are done in order to assure stability before rolling out in order to avoid future unexpected and unwanted issues on your end.

**The certification process**
Once you've reached this point, you'd be asked asked to notify your Nayax integrator about it and we'd send you a certification test file to match the flow you're using (Single Session/ Multisession/ Multivend).
The file includes explanations about the tests you need to do, as well as the steps that needs to be done in order to complete each one of them. As would have been explained to you during the integration, I would need you to enable the SDK's logging (and keep those on even after rollout, as this is Nayax's main debugging tool which would allow us to assist with figuring out any possible issues you encounter have after rollout) and have you send your Nayax integrator each test result in a different file.
The testing process is not long (assuming that the implementation was done properly) yet covers most if not all edge cases. During the testing process you would receive guidance and assistance form your Nayax integrator until completion.

**What happens once the certification is completed? And why is it important to allow rollout only after completing the certification?**
Once all of the mandatory tests are completed successfully, meaning your Nayax integrator has received the logs for them and approved of all of them- he would let the you know that the integration and certification process have been completed successfully by sending you an official certification letter and notify the distributor about it, and only at this point would the distributor allow you to roll out.

**️ Important note**

The certification is valid for 3 years- meaning after said time have passed there is a possibility that Nayax would require you to re-do the certification in order to ensure that your SDK implementation and everything Marshall-related is still operating as expected
