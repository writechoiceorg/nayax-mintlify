Cortina's integration process follows several stages, ensuring the solution is implemented and tested before going live. The diagram below illustrates the integration process.

The steps in this process are as follows:

1. **Kickoff**: This is an initial meeting between the integrator project and technical team, the Nayax Integration engineer, and the product team. The purpose of this meeting is to align expectations, define high-level goals, and introduce stakeholders from both sides.
2. **Scoping**: Once the integration is launched, the Integrator will complete an onboarding form that defines the integration requirements, use cases, and any limitations or dependencies.
3. **Test Environment Setup**: This is an internal setup at Nayax's end, as per the form completed by the issuer. Any networking requirements, such as VPN, will be set up during this stage as well. In this Stage, the integration engineer will also set up the testing Device and Machine on Nayax Core (Nayax back office).
4. **Development**: The integrator will begin implementing the Cortina API. The Nayax Integration engineer will be available for any queries or issues.
5. **Testing & Certification**: at this stage, the integrator should perform testing on his solution. Once the integrator is ready, he should complete the Cortina Certification, a list of tests assigned by Nayax to ensure the integrator implemented the Cortina solution correctly. Any additional certifications, such as EMV L3, should also be completed at this stage. Completing this stage is mandatory before the production setup can begin.
6. **Production Setup**: Once the Certification is approved, the Nayax integration engineer will complete the setup in the Production environment and process the integration on the Nayax Production server.
   If there are additional network requirements that were not completed at this stage, they will be completed during this stage.
7. **Pilot**: Launch with a limited number of active devices to validate real-world performance and identify any issues. The Pilot will run for an agreed time frame or until a substantial number of approved transactions are reached. Any problems discovered in this stage must be resolved before the project can be finalized.
8. **Finalization**: Once both sides agree that all issues have been resolved and are happy with the pilot results, the project will officially close and transition to ongoing support. Both sides will share the details of the Production support team, such as NOC, support, and operational teams.
