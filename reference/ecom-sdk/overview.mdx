The Nayax Ecom SDK API is designed to enable secure and efficient e-commerce transactions. It serves as a server-side interface for the Nayax SDK, handling core financial processes such as transaction initialization, payment processing, and card token management. The API supports various transaction types, including Card-on-File (COF), Customer-Initiated Transactions (CIT), and Merchant-Initiated Transactions (MIT).
